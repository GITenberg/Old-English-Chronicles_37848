<h2>EDITOR'S PREFACE.</h2>


<p>Of the present volume it will be sufficient to inform the
reader that it contains Six Chronicles, all relating to the
history of this country before the Norman Conquest, and
all of essential importance to those who like to study history
in the very words of contemporary writers.</p>

<p>We will at once proceed to enumerate them severally.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. I.</span>&mdash;ETHELWERD'S CHRONICLE.</h3>


<p>The short chronicle, which passes under the name of
Ethelwerd, contains few facts which are not found in the
Saxon Chronicle its precursor. Of the author we know no
more than he has told us in his work. "Malmesbury calls
him 'noble and magnificent' with reference to his rank; for
he was descended from king Alfred: but he forgets his peculiar
praise&mdash;that of being the only Latin historian for two
centuries; though, like Xenophon, C&aelig;sar, and Alfred, he
wielded the sword as much as the pen."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Ethelwerd dedicated his work to, and indeed wrote it for
the use of his relation Matilda, daughter of Otho the Great,
emperor of Germany, by his first empress Edgitha or
Editha; who is mentioned in the Saxon Chronicle, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>
925, though not by name, as given to Otho by her brother,
king Athelstan. Ethelwerd adds, in his epistle to Matilda,
that Athelstan sent <i>two</i> sisters, in order that the emperor
might take his choice; and that he preferred the mother of
Matilda.</p>

<p>The chronology of Ethelwerd is occasionally a year or two
at variance with other authorities. The reader will be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
guided in reckoning the dates, not by the heading of each
paragraph, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 891, 975, &amp;c., but by the actual words of the
author inserted in the body of the text.</p>

<p>I have translated this short chronicle from the original
text as well as I was able, and as closely as could be to the
author's text; but I am by no means certain of having always
succeeded in hitting on his true meaning, for such is the extraordinary
barbarism of the style, that I believe many an
ancient Latin classic, if he could rise from his grave, would
attempt in vain to interpret it.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. II.</span>&mdash;ASSER'S LIFE OF ALFRED.</h3>


<p>This work is ascribed, on its own internal authority, to
Asser, who is said to have been bishop of St. David's,
of Sherborne or of Exeter, in the time of king Alfred.
Though most of the public events recorded in this book
are to be found in the Saxon Chronicle, yet for many
interesting circumstances in the life of our great Saxon
king we are indebted to this biography alone. But, as if no
part of history is ever to be free from suspicion, or from
difficulty, a doubt has been raised concerning the authenticity
of this work.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> There is also another short treatise called the
Annals of Asser, or the Chronicle of St. Neot, different from
the present: it is published in vol. iii. of Gale and Fell's
Collection of Historians. And it has been suspected by a
living writer that both of these works are to be looked upon
as compilations of a later date. The arguments upon which
this opinion is founded are drawn principally from the abrupt
and incoherent character of the work before us. But
we have neither time nor space to enter further into this
question. As the work has been edited by Petrie, so has it
been here translated, and the reader, taking it upon its own
merits, will find therein much of interest about our glorious
king, concerning whom he will lament with me that all we
know is so little, so unsatisfying.</p>

however, in his recent work on the History and Antiquities of the

objections, and vindicated the authenticity of Asser's Life.</p></div>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. III.</span>&mdash;GILDAS.</h3>


<p>Of Gildas, the supposed author of the third work contained
in this volume, little or nothing is known. Mr. Stevenson,
in the preface to his edition of the original Latin,
lately published by the English Historical Society, says:
"We are unable to speak with certainty as to his parentage,
his country, or even his name, the period when he lived, or
the works of which he was the author." Such a statement
is surely sufficient to excuse us at present from saying more
on the subject, than that he is supposed to have lived, and to
have written what remains under his name, during some part
of the sixth century. There are two legends<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> of the life of
St. Gildas, as he is termed, but both of them abound with
such absurdities that they scarcely deserve to be noticed in
a serious history. Of the present translation, the first or
historic half is entirely new; in the rest, consisting almost
entirely of texts from Scripture, the translator has thought it
quite sufficient to follow the old translation of Habington,
correcting whatever errors he could detect, and in some
degree relieving the quaint and obsolete character of the
language. It has been remarked by Polydore Virgil, that
Gildas quotes no other book but the Bible; and it may be
added, that his quotations are in other words than those of
the Vulgate or common authorized translation. The title of
the old translation is as follows: "The Epistle of Gildas the
most ancient British Author: who flourished in the yeere
of our Lord, 546. And who by his great erudition, sanctitie,
and wisdome, acquired the name of <i>Sapiens</i>. Faithfully
translated out of the originall Latine." London, 12mo. 1638.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Both these works are given in the appendix to the editor's "History
of the Ancient Britons."</p></div>
</div>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. IV.</span>&mdash;NENNIUS.</h3>


<p>The History of the Britons, which occupies the fourth
place in this volume is generally ascribed to Nennius, but
so little is known about the author, that we have hardly any
information handed down to us respecting him except this
mention of his name. It is also far from certain at what
period the history was written, and the difference is no less
than a period of two hundred years, some assigning the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
work to seven hundred and ninety-six, and others to nine
hundred and ninety-four. The recent inquiries of Mr.
Stevenson, to be found in the Preface to his new edition of
the original Latin, render it unnecessary at present to delay
the reader's attention from the work itself. The present translation
is substantially that of the Rev. W. Gunn, published
with the Latin original in 1819, under the following title:
"The 'Historia Britonum,' commonly attributed to Nennius;
from a manuscript lately discovered in the library of the
Vatican Palace at Rome: edited in the tenth century, by
Mark the Hermit; with an English version, facsimile of the
original, notes and illustrations." The kindness of that gentleman
has enabled the present editor to reprint the whole, with
only a few corrections of slight errata, which inadvertency
alone had occasioned, together with the two prologues and
several pages of genealogies, which did not occur in the
MS. used by that gentleman.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. V.</span>&mdash;GEOFFREY OF MONMOUTH.</h3>


<p>Geoffrey, surnamed of Monmouth, is celebrated in English
literature as the author, or at least the translator, of <i>Historia
Britonum</i>, a work from which nearly all our great vernacular
poets have drawn the materials for some of their noblest
works of fiction and characters of romance. He lived in
the early part of the twelfth century, and in the year 1152
was raised to the bishopric of St. Asaph.</p>

<p>The first of his writings, in point of time, was a Latin
translation of the Prophecies of Merlin, which he undertook
at the request of Alexander bishop of Lincoln. His next
work was that on which his fame principally rests, the <i>Historia
Britonum</i>, dedicated to Robert, duke of Gloucester,
who died in 1147. Into this second work he inserted the
Latin translation above-mentioned, which now appears as
the seventh book of <i>Historia Britonum</i>. A third composition
has also been ascribed to Geoffrey, entitled <i>Vita Merlini</i>,
in Latin hexameter verse: but the internal evidence which it
affords, plainly proves that it is the work of a different author.</p>

<p>Although the list of our Chroniclers may be considered
as complete, without the addition of this work, yet we
have thought it worthy of a place in our series for many
reasons. It is not for historical accuracy that the book be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>fore
us is valuable; for the great mass of scholars have come
to the decided conviction that it is full of fables. But it is
the romantic character which pervades the narrative, together
with its acknowledged antiquity, which make it desirable
that the book should not sink into oblivion. Those who
desire to possess it as a venerable relic of an early age, will now
have an opportunity of gratifying their wish; whilst others,
who despise it as valueless, in their researches after historic
truth, may, nevertheless, find some little pleasure in the tales
of imagination which it contains.</p>

<p>The value of this work is best evinced by the attention
which was paid to it for many centuries; Henry of Huntingdon
made an abstract of it, which he subjoined as an
appendix to his history: and Alfred of Beverley, a later
writer, in his abridgment of this work which still exists,
has omitted Geoffrey's name, though he calls the author of
the original, Britannicus.</p>

<p>An English translation of the work was first published by
Aaron Thompson, of Queen's College, Oxford, [8vo. Lond.
1718.] and lately revised and reprinted by the editor of this
volume, [8vo. Lond. 1842.] A long preface is prefixed to
that translation, wherein the author endeavoured to prove
Geoffrey of Monmouth to be a more faithful historian than
he is generally considered to be. His words are as follow:&mdash;"I
am not unsensible that I expose myself to the censures
of some persons, by publishing this translation of a book,
which they think had better been suppressed and buried in
oblivion, as being at present generally exploded for a groundless
and fabulous story, such as our modern historians think
not worthy relating, or at least mention with contempt. And
though it is true, several men, and those of learning too,
censure this book who have but little considered it, and
whose studies no ways qualify them to judge of it; yet, I
own this consideration has for a long time deterred me from
publishing it: and I should not at last have been able to
surmount this difficulty, without the importunity and encouragement
of others, to whom I owe a singular regard. I
had indeed before I entered upon the work perused the principal
writers both for and against this history, the effect of
which upon my own judgment, as to the swaying it to the
one side more than the other, was but very small; and I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
must confess, that I find the most learned antiquaries the
most modest in their opinions concerning it, and that it seems
to me to be a piece of great rashness, to judge peremptorily
upon a matter, whereof at this great distance of time there
are no competent witnesses on either side. At least I cannot
but think it a sufficient apology for my publishing this
book, to consider only, that though it seems to suffer under a
general prejudice at present, yet it has not long done so;
but that upon its first appearing in the world, it met with
a universal approbation, and that too, from those who had
better opportunities of examining the truth of it, as there
were then more monuments extant, and the traditions more
fresh and uncorrupted concerning the ancient British affairs,
than any critics of the present age can pretend to; that it
had no adversary before William of Newburgh about the
end of the reign of Richard the First, whose virulent invective
against it, we are told, proceeded from a revenge he
thought he owed the Welsh for an affront they had given
him; that his opposition was far from shaking the credit of
it with our succeeding historians, who have, most of them,
till the beginning of the last century, confirmed it with their
testimonies, and copied after it, as often as they had occasion
to treat of the same affairs: that its authority was alleged by
king Edward the First and all the nobility of the kingdom,
in a controversy of the greatest importance, before Boniface
the Eighth; that even in this learned age, that is so industrious
to detect any impostures, which through the credulity
of former times had passed upon the world, the arguments
against this history are not thought so convincing, but that
several men of equal reputation for learning and judgment
with its adversaries, have written in favour of it; that very
few have at last spoken decisively against it, or absolutely
condemned it; and that it is still most frequently quoted by
our most learned historians and antiquaries. All these considerations,
I say, if they do not amount to an apology for the
history itself, show at least that it deserves to be better
known than at present it is; which is sufficient to justify my
undertaking the publishing of it."</p>

<p>It is unnecessary in the present day to prove that king
Brute is a shadowy personage, who never existed but in the
regions of romance: but as the reader may justly expect to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
find in this place some account of the controversy which has
existed respecting this work, the following remarks will not
be deemed inappropriate. There seems no good reason for
supposing that Geoffrey of Monmouth intended to deceive
the world respecting the history of which he professed to be
the translator; and it may be readily conceived that he did
no more than fulfil the task which he had undertaken,
of rendering the book into Latin out of the original language.
But those who, even as late as the beginning of the last
century, supported the authenticity of the history, have
grounded their opinions on such arguments as the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. That, upon its first appearance in the world, the book
met with universal approbation, and that too from those who
had better opportunities of examining the truth of it, as
there were then more monuments extant, and the traditions
were more fresh and uncorrupted, concerning the ancient
British affairs, than any critics of the present age can pretend
to.</p>

<p>2. That except William of Newburgh, about the end of
the reign of Richard I, it met with no opponents even down
to the seventeenth century, but was, on the contrary, quoted
by all, in particular by Edward I, in a controversy before
Boniface the Eighth.</p>

<p>3. That we see in this history the traces of venerable
antiquity.</p>

<p>4. That the story of Brute, and the descent of the Britons
from the Trojans, was universally allowed by Giraldus Cambrensis
and others, and was opposed for the first time by
John of Wethamstede, [Nicolson's Eng. Hist. Lit. 2nd ed.
p. 1, c. v.] who lived in the 15th century: that Polydore
Virgil's contempt for it proceeded from his wish to preserve
unimpaired the glory of the Romans, and Buchanan's observations
betray his ignorance of the story.</p>

<p>5. That Leland, who lived under Henry the Eighth,
Humphrey Lhwyd, Sir John Price, Dr. Caius, Dr. Powel,
and others, have supported the story of Brute, etc.</p>

<p>Such arguments may have satisfied the credulous students
of the seventeenth century, but the more enlightened criticism
of the present day will no longer listen to them. It
may not, however, be uninteresting to hear the account which
Thompson, the English translator gives of this work, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
in his own words, and with his additional remarks upon it,
is as follows:&mdash;"The story, as collected from himself, Leland,
Bale, and Pitts, is that Walter Mapes, <i>alias</i> Calenius, archdeacon
of Oxford, who flourished in the reign of Henry I,
and of whom Henry of Huntingdon, and other historians as
well as Geoffrey himself, make honourable mention, being a
man very curious in the study of antiquity, and a diligent
searcher into ancient libraries, and especially after the works
of ancient authors, happened while he was in Armorica to
light upon a History of Britain, written in the British
tongue, and carrying marks of great antiquity. And being
overjoyed at it, as if he had found a vast treasure, he in a
short time after came over to England; where inquiring for a
proper person to translate this curious but hitherto unknown
book, he very opportunely met with Geoffrey of Monmouth,
a man profoundly versed in the history and antiquities of
Britain, excellently skilled in the British tongue, and withal
(considering the time,) an elegant writer both in verse and
prose; and so recommended this task to him. Accordingly,
Geoffrey, being incredibly delighted with this ancient book,
undertook the translating of it into Latin, which he performed,
with great diligence, approving himself, according to Matthew
Paris, a faithful translator. At first he divided it into four
books, written in a plain simple style, and dedicated it to
Robert, earl of Gloucester, a copy whereof is said<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> to be at
Bennet College, in Cambridge, which was never yet published;
but afterwards he made some alterations and divided
it into eight books, to which he added the book of Merlin's
Prophecies, which he had also translated from British verse
into Latin prose, prefixing to it a preface, and a letter
to Alexander, bishop of Lincoln. A great many fabulous
and trifling stories are inserted in the history: but that was
not his fault; his business as a translator was to deliver
them faithfully such as they were, and leave them to the
judgment of the learned to be discussed.</p>

<p>"To prove the truth of this relation, and to answer at
once all objections against Geoffrey's integrity, one needs no
other argument than an assurance that the original manuscript
which Geoffrey translated, of whose antiquity the curious
are able to judge in a great measure by the character, or any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
ancient and authentic copy of it, is yet extant. And indeed,
archbishop Usher<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> mentions an old Welsh Chronicle
in the Cottonian Library, that formerly was in the possession
of that learned antiquary, Humphrey Lhwyd, which he says
is thought to be that which Geoffrey translated. But if that
be the original manuscript, it must be acknowledged that
Geoffrey was not merely a translator, but made some additions
of his own: since, as that most learned prelate informs
us, the account that we have in this History of the British
Flamens, and Archflamens, is nowhere to be found in it.
But besides this, there are several copies of it in the Welsh
tongue, mentioned by the late ingenious and learned Mr.
Lhwyd in his 'Arch&aelig;ologia Britannica.' And I myself
have met with a manuscript history of our British affairs,
written above a hundred years ago by Mr. John Lewis, and
shortly to be published, wherein the author says, that he had
the original of the British History in parchment written in
the British tongue before Geoffrey's time, as he concludes
from this circumstance, that in his book Geoffrey's preface was
wanting, and the preface to his book was the second chapter
of that published by Geoffrey. My ignorance of the Welsh
tongue renders me unqualified for making any search into
these matters; and though the search should be attended with
never so much satisfaction, to those who are able to judge of
the antiquity of manuscripts, yet to the generality of readers,
other arguments would perhaps be more convincing."</p>

<p>The passages which we have here quoted at length, will
give the reader the most ample information concerning the
nature of the question, and it only remains to inform the
reader what is my own opinion on this long-agitated literary
controversy.</p>

<p>To those who have read the plain and simple statements
of Julius C&aelig;sar and the other classic historians who have
described the early state of Britain, it will be morally certain
that all such accounts as we have in Geoffrey of Monmouth
are purely fabulous. The uncertainty of every thing, save
the bare fact, connected with the siege of Troy, is so great,
that to connect its fortunes with those of a distant and at
that time unheard-of island like Britain, can be admissible
only in the pages of romance. But in the latter part of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
work which contains the history of Britain, during its conquest
by the Saxons, we may possibly find the germs of
facts unnoticed elsewhere.</p>

<p>This view does not militate against the veracity of Geoffrey,
who professes to have translated from an original in the
British language, but whether any manuscript copy of this
original now exists, is a point which has not been satisfactorily
ascertained. In 1811, the Rev. Peter Roberts published
the Chronicle of the Kings of Britain, translated from
Welsh manuscripts, and being in substance almost identically
the same as Geoffrey's History of the Britons,&mdash;but it is most
likely that these Welsh MSS., which are all comparatively
modern, are themselves re-translations from the Latin of
Geoffrey.</p>

<p>If no other arguments could be adduced to prove the utter
incredibility of the earlier parts of this history, the following
Chronological Table would furnish quite sufficient arguments
to establish it, by the extraordinary anachronisms which it contains.
For instance, between the reigns of Brutus and Leil, is
an interval of 156 years; and yet Geoffrey makes the capture
of the ark contemporaneous with the reign of Brutus, and
the building of Solomon's temple with that of Leil. Now
the interval between these two events cannot by any possibility
be extended beyond eighty years. It is, moreover,
impossible to bring the chronology of the British kings themselves
into harmony with the dates before Christ, as there
is no mention made of the exact interval between the taking
of Troy and Brutus's landing in Britain.</p>

<p>Geoffrey inscribes his work to Robert, earl of Gloucester,
son of Henry the Second.</p>

<h3>THE CHRONICLE</h3>

<h5>OF</h5>

<h2>FABIUS ETHELWERD,</h2>

<h5>FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE WORLD TO THE YEAR OF
OUR LORD 975.</h5>

<h3>IN FOUR BOOKS.</h3>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>To Matilda, the most eloquent and true handmaid of Christ,
Ethelwerd the patrician, health in the Lord! I have received,
dearest sister, your letter which I longed for, and I
not only read it with kisses, but laid it up in the treasury of
my heart. Often and often do I pray the grace of the Most
High, to preserve you in safety during this life present, and
after death to lead you to his everlasting mansions. But as
I once before briefly hinted to you by letter, I now, with
God's help, intend to begin in the way of annals from the
beginning of the world, and explain to you more fully about
our common lineage and descent, to the end that the reader's
task may be lightened, and the pleasure of the hearer may
be augmented, whilst he listens to it. Concerning the coming
of our first parents out of Germany into Britain, their numberless
wars and slaughters, and the dangers which they encountered
on ship-board among the waves of the ocean, in
the following pages you will find a full description. In the
present letter therefore I have written, without perplexity of
style, of our modern lineage and relationship, who were our
relations, and how, and where they came from: as far as our
memory can go, and according as our parents taught us. For
instance king Alfred was son of king Ethelwulf, from whom
we derive our origin, and who had five sons, one of whom
was king Ethelred<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> my ancestor, and another king Alfred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
who was yours. This king Alfred sent his daughter Ethelswitha
into Germany to be the wife of Baldwin,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> who had by
her two sons Ethelwulf and Arnulf, also two daughters Elswid
and Armentruth. Now from Ethelswitha is descended
count Arnulf,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> your neighbour. The daughter of king
Edward son of the above-named king Alfred was named
Edgiva, and was sent by your aunt into Gaul to marry
Charles the Simple. Ethilda also was sent to be the wife of
Hugh, son of Robert: and two others were sent by king
Athelstan to Otho that he might choose which of them he
liked best to be his wife. He<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> chose Edgitha, from whom
you derive your lineage; and united the other in marriage
to a certain king<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> near the Jupiterean Mountains, of whose
family no memorial has reached us, partly from the distance
and partly from the confusion of the times. It is your
province to inform us of these particulars, not only from your
relationship, but also because no lack of ability or interval
of space prevents you.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<h3>BOOK THE FIRST BEGINS.</h3>


<p>The beginning of the world comes first. For on the first
day God, in the apparition of the light, created the angels:
on the second day, under the name of the firmament he
created the heavens; &amp;c. &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Rome was destroyed by the Goths in the eleven hundred
and forty-sixth year after it was built. From that time the
Roman authority ceased in the island of Britain, and in
many other countries which they had held under the yoke of
slavery. For it was now four hundred and eighty-five years,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
beginning with Caius Julius C&aelig;sar, that they had held the
island above-mentioned, wherein they had built cities and
castles, bridges and streets of admirable construction, which
are seen among us even to the present day. But whilst the
people of Britain were living carelessly within the wall,
which had been built by Severus to protect them, there arose
two nations, the Picts in the north and the Scots in the west,
and leading an army against them, devastated their country,
and inflicted many sufferings upon them for many years.
The Britons being unable to bear their misery, by a wise
device send to Rome a mournful letter<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> ... the army
returned victorious to Rome. But the Scots and Picts,
hearing that the hostile army was gone, rejoiced with no little
joy. Again they take up arms, and like wolves attack the
sheepfold which is left without a protector: they devastate
the northern districts as far as the ditch of Severus: the
Britons man the wall and fortify it with their arms; but
fortune denied them success in the war. The cunning Scots,
knowing what to do against the high wall and the deep
trench, contrive iron goads with mechanical art, and dragging
down those who were standing on the wall, slay them
without mercy: they remain victors both within and without;
they at once plunder and take possession; and a
slaughter is made worse than all that had been before. Thus
ended the four hundred and forty-fourth year since the incarnation
of our Lord.</p>

<p>The Britons, seeing themselves on every side vanquished,
and that they could have no more hopes from Rome, devise,
in their agony and lamentations, a plan to adopt. For in
those days they heard, that the race of the Saxons were
active, in piratical enterprises, throughout the whole coast,
from the river Rhine to the Danish city,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> which is now commonly
called Denmark, and strong in all matters connected
with war. They therefore send to them messengers, bearing
gifts, and ask assistance, promising them their alliance when
they should be at peace. But the mind of that degraded
race was debased by ignorance, and they saw not that they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
were preparing for themselves perpetual slavery, which is
the stepmother of all misfortune.</p>

<p>The person who especially gave this counsel was Vurthern,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
who at that time was king over all, and to him all the
nobility assented. They preferred to procure assistance to
them from Germany. Already two young men, Hengist
and Horsa, were pre-eminent. They were the grandsons
of Woden, king of the barbarians, whom the pagans have
since raised to an abominable dignity, and honouring him as
a god, offer sacrifice to him for the sake of victory or valour,
and the people, deceived, believe what they see, as is their
wont. The aforesaid youths therefore arrive, according to
the petition of the king and his senate, with three vessels,
loaded with arms, and prepared with every kind of warlike
stores: the anchor is cast into the sea, and the ships come to
land. Not long afterwards they are sent against the Scots
to try their mettle, and without delay they sheathe their
breasts in arms, and engage in a novel mode of battle. Man
clashes with man, now falls a German and now a Scot: on
both sides is a most wretched scene of slaughter: at length
the Saxons remain masters of the field. For this the king
aforesaid honours them with a triumph; and they privately
send home messengers, to tell their countrymen of the fertility
of the country and the indolence of its cowardly people.
Their countrymen, without delay, listen to their representations,
and send to them a large fleet and army. Forthwith
they were magnificently received by the king of the Britons,
and contracted a league of hospitality with the natives. The
Britons promise peace, worthy gifts of alliance and honours,
provided that they might remain in ease under their protection
from the attacks of their enemies, and pay them immense
stipends.</p>

<p>Thus much of the alliance and promises of the Britons:
now let us speak of their discord and ill fortune. For seeing
the cunningness of the new people, they partly feared and
partly despised them. They break their compact, and no
longer render them the honours of alliance, but instead
thereof, they try to drive them from their shores. These
being their designs, the thing is made public, the treaty is
openly set aside, all parties fly to arms: the Britons give<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
way, and the Saxons keep possession of the country. Again
they send to Germany, not secretly as before, but by a public
embassy, as victors are wont to do, and demand reinforcements.
A large multitude joined them from every province
of Germany; and they carried on war against the Britons,
driving them from their territories with great slaughter, and
ever remaining masters of the field. At last the Britons
bend their necks to the yoke, and pay tribute. This migration
is said to have been made from the three provinces of
Germany, which are said to have been the most distinguished,
namely, from Saxony, Anglia, and Giota. The
Cantuarians derived their origin from the Giot&aelig; [Jutes],
and also the Uuhtii, who took their name from the island
Wihta [Isle of Wight], which lies on the coast of Britain.</p>

<p>For out of Saxony, which is now called Ald-Sexe, or Old
Saxony, came the tribes which are still called so among the
English, the East Saxons, South Saxons, and West Saxons;
that is, those who are called in Latin, the Oriental, Austral,
and Occidental Saxons.</p>

<p>Out of the province of Anglia came the East Anglians,
Middle Anglians, Mercians, and all the race of the Northumbrians.
Moreover Old Anglia is situated between the
Saxons and Jutes, having a capital town, which in Saxon is
called Sleswig, but in Danish Haithaby. Britain, therefore,
is now called Anglia [England], because it took the name of
its conquerors: for their leaders aforesaid were the first who
came thence to Britain; namely, Hengist and Horsa, sons of
Wyhrtels:<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> their grandfather was Wecta, and their great-grandfather
Withar, whose father was Woden, who also
was king of a multitude of barbarians. For the unbelievers
of the North are oppressed by such delusion that they worship
him as a god even to this day, namely the Danes, the
North-men, and the Suevi; of whom Lucan says,</p>

<p>
"Pours forth the yellow Suevi from the North."<br />
</p>

<p>So greatly did the invasion of those nations spread and
increase, that they by degrees obliterated all memory of the
inhabitants who had formerly invited them with gifts. They
demand their stipends: the Britons refuse: they take up
arms, discord arises, and as we have before said, they drive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
the Britons into certain narrow isthmuses of the island, and
themselves hold possession of the island from sea to sea even
unto the present time.</p>

<p>A. 418. In the ninth year also after the sacking of Rome
by the Goths, those of Roman race who were left in Britain,
not bearing the manifold insults of the people, bury their
treasures in pits thinking that hereafter they might have
better fortune, which never was the case; and taking a portion,
assemble on the coast, spread their canvas to the winds,
and seek an exile on the shores of Gaul.</p>

<p>A. 430. Twelve years after, bishop Palladius is sent by
the holy pope Celestinus to preach the gospel of Christ to
the Scots.</p>

<p>A. 449. When, therefore, nineteen years had elapsed,
Maurice and Valentine<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> became emperors of Rome; in
whose reign Hengist and Horsa at the invitation of Vortigern
king of the Britons arrive at the place called Wipped's-fleet,
at first on the plea of assisting the Britons:
but afterwards they rebelled and became their enemies, as
we have already said. Now the number of years, completed
since the marvellous incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ,
was four hundred and forty-nine.</p>

<p>A. 455. In the sixth year after, Hengist and Horsa
fought a battle against Vortigern in the plain of &AElig;gelsthrep.
There Horsa was killed, and Hengist obtained the
kingdom.</p>

<p>A. 457. But after two years, Hengist and &AElig;sc his son
renewed the war against the Britons; and there fell in that
day on the side of the Britons four thousand men. Then
the Britons, leaving Cantia, which is commonly called Kent,
fled to the city of London.</p>

<p>A. 465. About eight years after, the same men took up
arms against the Britons, and there was a great slaughter
made on that day: twelve chiefs of the Britons fell near a
place called Wipped's-fleet; there fell a soldier of the Saxons
called Wipped, from which circumstance that place took its
name; in the same way as the Thesean sea was so called<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
from Theseus, and the &AElig;g&aelig;an sea from &AElig;geus who was
drowned in it.</p>

<p>A. 473. After eight years were completed, Hengist with
his son &AElig;sc, a second time make war against the Britons,
and having slaughtered their army, remain victors on the
field of battle, and carry off immense spoils.</p>

<p>A. 477. In the fourth year &AElig;lla landed in Britain from
Germany with his three sons, at a place called Cymenes-Ora,
and defeated the Britons at Aldredes-leage.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>A. 485. After eight years, the same people fight against
the Britons, near a place called Mearcr&aelig;dsburn.</p>

<p>A. 488. After this, at an interval of three years, &AElig;sc,
son of Hengist, began to reign in Kent.</p>

<p>A. 492. After three years, &AElig;lla and Assa besieged a
town called Andreds-cester, and slew all its inhabitants,
both small and great, leaving not a single soul alive.</p>

<p>A. 495. After the lapse of three more years, Cerdic and
his son Cynric sailed to Britain with five ships, to a port
called Cerdic's-ore, and on the same day fought a battle
against the Britons, in which they were finally victorious.</p>

<p>A. 500. Six years after their arrival, they sailed round
the western part of Britain, which is now called Wessex.</p>

<p>A. 501. Also after a year Port landed in Britain with his
son Bieda.</p>

<p>A. 508. Seven years after his arrival, Cerdic with his son
Cynric slay Natan-Leod, king of the Britons, and five thousand
men with him.</p>

<p>A. 514. Six years after, Stuf and Wihtgar landed in
Britain at Cerdic's-ore, and suddenly make war on the Britons,
whom they put to flight, and themselves remain masters
of the field. Thus was completed the fifty-sixth<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> year since
Hengist and Horsa first landed in Britain.</p>

<p>A. 519. Five years after, Cerdic and Cynric fought a
battle against the Britons at Cerdic's-ford,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> on the river
Avene, and that same year nominally began to reign.</p>

<p>A. 527. Eight years after, they renew the war against the
Britons.</p>

<p>A. 530. After three years, they took the Isle of Wight,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
the situation of which we have mentioned above: but they
did not kill many of the Britons.</p>

<p>A. 534. Four years after, Cerdic with his son Cenric gives
up the Isle of Wight into the hands of their two cousins
Stuf and Wihtgar. In the course of the same year Cerdic
died, and Cenric his son began to reign after him, and he
reigned twenty-seven years.</p>

<p>A. 538. When he had reigned four years, the sun was
eclipsed from the first hour of the day to the third.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>A. 540. Again, two years after, the sun was eclipsed for
half-an-hour after the third hour, so that the stars were
everywhere visible in the sky.</p>

<p>A. 547. In the seventh year after this, Ida began to
reign over the province of Northumberland, whose family
derive their kingly title and nobility from Woden.</p>

<p>A. 552. Five years after, Cenric fought against the Britons
near the town of Scarburh [Old Sarum], and, having routed
them, slew a large number.</p>

<p>A. 556. The same, four years afterwards, fought with
Ceawlin against the Britons, near a place called Berin-byrig
[Banbury?]</p>

<p>A. 560. At the end of about four years, Ceawlin began
to reign over the western part of Britain, which is now commonly
called Wessex. Moreover, Ella the Iffing is sent to
the race of Northumbria, whose ancestry extends up to the
highest, namely to Woden.</p>

<p>A. 565. Five years afterwards, Christ's servant Columba
came from Scotia [Ireland] to Britain, to preach the word of
God to the Picts.</p>

<p>A. 568. Three years after his coming, Ceawlin and Cutha
stirred up a civil war against Ethelbert, and having defeated
him, pursued him into Kent, and slew his two chiefs, Oslaf
and Cnebba, in Wubbandune.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>A. 571. After three years, Cuthulf fought against the
Britons at Bedanford [Bedford], and took four royal cities,
namely Liganburh [Lenbury], Eglesburh [Aylesbury], Bensingtun
[Benson], and Ignesham [Eynsham].</p>

<p>A. 577. After the lapse of six years, Cuthwin and Ceawlin
fight against the Britons, and slay three of their kings,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
Comail, Condidan, and Farinmeail, at a place called Deorhamme
[Derham?]; and they took three of their most
distinguished cities, Gloucester, Cirencester, and Bath.</p>

<p>A. 584. After seven years, Ceawlin and Cutha fought
against the Britons, at a place called Fethanleage [Frethern?]:
there Cutha fell; but Ceawlin reduced a multitude of cities,
and took immense spoils.</p>

<p>A. 592. In the eighth year there was a great slaughter on
both sides, at a place called Wodnesbyrg [Wemborow?], so
that Ceawlin was put to flight, and died at the end of one
more year.</p>

<p>A. 593. After him, Cwichelm, Crida, and Ethelfrid, succeeded
to the kingdom.</p>

<h3>HERE BEGINS THE PROLOGUE TO BOOK THE SECOND.</h3>


<p>In the beginning of this book it will not be necessary to
make a long preface, my dearest sister; for I have guided
my pen down through many perplexed subjects from the
highest point, and, omitting those things extracted from sacred
and profane history, on which most persons have fixed
their attention, have left higher matters to the skilful reader.
And now I must turn my pen to the description of those
things which properly concern our ancestors; and though a
pupil is not properly called a member, yet it yields no little
service to the other members.</p>

<p>We therefore entreat in God's name that our words may
not be despised by the malevolent, but rather that they may
give abundant thanks to the King of heaven, if they seem to
speak things of high import.</p>

<h4>
HERE ENDS THE PROLOGUE;<br /><br />
AND<br /><br />
THE SECOND BOOK BEGINS.<br />
</h4>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. I.</span>&mdash;<i>Of the coming of Augustine, who was sent by the blessed Pope
Gregory.</i> [<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 596.]</h3>


<p>As Divine Providence, mercifully looking down upon all
things from all eternity, is accustomed to rule them, not by
necessity, but by its powerful superintendence, and remain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>ing
always immoveable in itself, and disposing the different
elements by its word, and the human race to come to the
knowledge of the truth by the death of his only begotten
Son, by whose blood the four quarters of the world are redeemed,
so now by his servant doth it dispel the darkness in
the regions of the west.</p>

<p>Whilst therefore the blessed pope Gregory sat on the
episcopal seat, and sowed the seeds of the gospel of Christ,
there stood by him some men of unknown tongue and very
comely to look on. The holy man admiring the beauty of
their countenances, asked of them with earnestness from what
country they came. The young men with downcast looks
replied, that they were Angles. "Are you Christians," said
the holy man, "or heathens?" "Certainly not Christians,"
said they, "for no one has yet opened our ears." Then the
holy man, lifting up his eyes, replied, "What man, when
there are stones at hand, lays a foundation with reeds?"
They answer, "No man of prudence." "You have well
said," answered he; and he straightway took them into a
room, where he instructed them in the divine oracles, and
afterwards washed them with the baptism of Christ: and
further he arranged with them, that he would go with them
into their country. When the Romans heard of this they
opposed his words, and were unwilling to allow their pastor
to go so far from home. The blessed pope Gregory, therefore,
seeing that the people were opposed to him, sent with
the men aforesaid one of his disciples, who was well instructed
in the divine oracles, by name Augustine, and with him a
multitude of brethren. When these men arrived, the English
received the faith and erected temples, and our Saviour
Jesus Christ exhibited innumerable miracles to his faithful
followers through the prayers of the bishop, St. Augustine;
at whose tomb, even to the present day, no small number of
miracles are wrought, with the assistance of our Lord.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. II.</span>&mdash;<i>Of king Ethelbert, and of his baptism.</i> [<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 597.]</h3>


<p>When the man aforesaid arrived, Ethelbert bore rule over
Kent, and receiving the faith, submitted to be baptized with
all his house. He was the first king among the English who
received the word of Christ. Lastly Ethelbert was the son<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
of Ermenric, whose grandfather was Ochta, who bore the
pr&aelig;nomen of Eisc,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> from which the kings of Kent were
afterwards named Esings, as the Romans from Romulus, the
Cecropid&aelig; from Cecrops, and the Tuscans from Tuscus.
For Eisc was the father of Hengist, who was the first
consul and leader of the Angles out of Germany; whose
father was Wihtgils, his grandfather Witta, his great-grandfather
Wecta, his great-grandfather's father Woden, who
also was king of many nations, whom some of the pagans
now still worship as a god. And the number of years that
was completed from the incarnation of our Lord was four
years less, than six hundred.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>A. 597. At the end of one year, Ceolwulf began to reign
over the Western English.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> His family was derived from

<p>A. 606. Two years afterwards, the blessed pope Gregory
departed this world, in the eleventh year after he had
bestowed baptism on the English by sending among them
Christ's servant Augustine. And the number of years that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>

fought against Penda at Cirencester.</p>

<p>A. 635. After six years bishop Birinus came among the
Western Angles, preaching to them the gospel of Christ.

Britain out of Germany, was about one hundred and twenty.
At that time Cynegils received baptism from the holy bishop
Birinus, in a town called Dorchester.</p>

named Hamptonshire [Hampshire]. And he remained there no

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XVIII.</span>&mdash;<i>Of the reign of Cynewulf, his war and deeds.</i></h3>


<p>A. 755. These things having been premised, Cynewulf frequently
fought no slight battles against the Britons. For
when thirty-one years had passed, he tried to expel from his
territories a certain chief named Cyneard, brother to Sigebert,
whose deeds have been related above. He was afterwards
besieged by this prince, for it was told him that he was
in company of a certain courtezan at a place called Meranton
[Merton], and though he had with him only a few men, who
knew nothing of the matter, he surrounded the house with
arms. The king, seeing how he was situated, leaped to the
door, and bravely repelled their weapons; but making up his
mind he rushed upon the prince, and inflicted no slight wounds
upon him; his companions, not forgetting his threats, raised
their weapons and slew the king. The report being spread,
the king's soldiers, who had been in his company, each for
himself, as was their custom, made an attack, uttering shouts.
But the prince, soothing them, promised them gifts and ample
honours. They desire death, now that their lord is dead;
nor do they attend to his promises, but rush with one accord
upon death. None of them escaped with life except one
British hostage, and he had received severe wounds. When,
therefore, the day dawned, it became known to the soldiers,
who had remained behind the king's back, they assembled
together and set forth, and with them Osric the duke and
Wigferth the knight. They found the prince in the house,
where their master was lying dead. The doors are beleaguered
on both sides. Within are the one party, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
other party are without. The prince asks a truce, and makes
ample promises; his object is future sovereignty. The
king's friends spurn these offers, and rather seek to separate
from the prince their relations who were in his company.
These reject their proposals; on the contrary they answer
their friends thus:<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> "No tie is so powerful as that which
binds us to our lord; and whereas you ask us to depart, we
tell you that we made the same proposal to those who were slain
with your king, and they would not accede to it." To this
the other party rejoined, "But you will remain unhurt, if
you only depart, nor share in the vengeance which we shall
inflict for those who were slain with the king." They returned
no answer to this, but silently begin the battle; shield
punishes shield, and arms are laced in bucklers, relation falls
by his kinsman; they smash the doors, one pursues after another,
and a lamentable fight ensues. Alas! they slay the
prince; all his companions are laid low before his face, except
one, and he was the baptismal son of duke Osric, but half
alive, and covered with wounds.</p>

<p>Now Cynewulf reigned thirty-one years, and his body lies
entombed in the city of Winchester. The above-named prince
also reposes in the church commonly called Axanminster.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
Both their families trace to Cerdic.</p>

<p>A. 755. In the same year Ethelbald, king of Mercia, was
slain at a place called Seccandune,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> and his body rests in a

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XIX.</span>&mdash;<i>Of the reign of king Offa and of his deeds.</i></h3>

his grandfather was Enwulf, his great-grandfather
Osmod, his great-grandfather's father Pybba, his great-grandfather's

<p>A. 773. Also after seventeen years, from the time that
Cynewulf took the kingdom from Sigebert, the sign of our
Lord's cross appeared in the heavens after sun-set, and in the
same year a civil contest<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> took place between the people of
Kent and Mercia, at a place called Cittanford:<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> and in those
days some monstrous serpents were seen in the country of the
Southern Angles, which is called Sussex.</p>

<p>A. 777. About four years after, Cynewulf and Offa fought
a battle near the town of Bensington, which was gained by
Offa.</p>

<p>A. 779. Two years afterwards, the Gauls and Saxons
stirred up no slight contests with one another.</p>

Cynewulf, and is himself also slain there.</p>

<h4>HERE ENDS THE PROLOGUE,<br /><br />
AND THE BOOK BEGINS.</h4>


<p>Whilst the pious king Bertric was reigning over the western
parts of the English, and the innocent people spread
through their plains were enjoying themselves in tranquillity
and yoking their oxen to the plough, suddenly there arrived
on the coast a fleet of Danes, not large, but of three ships
only: this was their first arrival. When this became known,
the king's officer, who was already stopping in the town of
Dorchester, leaped on his horse and gallopped forwards with
a few men to the port, thinking that they were merchants
rather than enemies, and, commanding them in an authoritative
tone, ordered them to be made to go to the royal city;
but he was slain on the spot by them, and all who were with
him. The name of the officer was Beaduherd.</p>

<p>A. 787. And the number of years that was fulfilled was
above three hundred and thirty-four, from the time that Hengist
and Horsa arrived in Britain, in which also Bertric
married the daughter of king Offa.</p>

<p>A. 792. Moreover, it was after five years that Offa king
of the Mercians commanded the head of king Ethelbert to be
struck off.</p>

<p>A. 794. After two years Offa also died, and Egfert his
son succeeded to the kingdom, and died in the same year.
Pope Adrian also departed this life. Ethelred, king of the
Northumbrians, was slain by his own people.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. I.</span>&mdash;<i>Of Kenulf, king of the Mercians, and of his wars.</i></h3>

ravaged Kent and the province which is called Merscwari,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
and their king Pren was taken, whom they loaded with
chains, and led as far as Mercia.</p>

<p>A. 797. Then after a year, the enraged populace of Rome
cut out the tongue of the blessed pope Leo, and tore out his
eyes, and drove him from his apostolical seat. But suddenly,
by the aid of Christ, who is always wonderful in his works,
his sight was restored, and his tongue regifted with speech,
and he resumed his seat of apostleship as before.</p>

<p>A. 800. After three years, king Bertric died.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. II.</span>&mdash;<i>Of the reign of Egbert, and his deeds.</i></h3>


<p>Therefore Egbert is raised to the kingdom of the West
Saxons. On the very same day, as king Ethelmund was
passing through a farm, Wiccum, intending to go to a ford
called Cynem&aelig;resford [Kempsford], duke Woxstan met him
there with the centuries of the inhabitants of the province
of Wils&aelig;tum [Wiltshire]. Both of them fell in the battle,
but the Wils&aelig;t&aelig; remained the victors.</p>

<p>Also, down to the time that Egbert received the kingdom,
there were completed from the beginning of the world 5995
years, from the incarnation of our Lord 800 years, from the
coming of Hengist and Horsa into Britain 350 years, from
the reign of Cerdic, the tenth ancestor of king Egbert, when
he subdued the western part of Britain, 300 years, and from
the coming of Augustine, who was sent by the blessed pope
Gregory to baptize the English nation, 204 years: and in
the tenth year afterwards the holy father Gregory died.</p>

<p>A. 805. After king Egbert had reigned five years, was the
death of Cuthred king of Kent.</p>

<p>A. 812. In the seventh year Charles, king of the Franks,
departed this life.</p>

<p>A. 814. After two years, the blessed pope Leo passed
from one virtue to another.</p>

<p>A. 819. After five years, Kenulf king of the Mercians
died.</p>

<p>A. 821. His successor was Ceolwulf, who was deprived
of the kingdom two years afterwards.</p>

<p>A. 822. A year afterwards a great synod was held at a
place called Cloveshoo,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> and two dukes were there slain
Burhelm and Mucca.</p>

<p>A. 823. After one year a battle was fought against the
Britons in the province of Defna [Devonshire], at a place
called Camelford. In the same year king Egbert fought a
battle against Bernulf king of the Mercians at Ellendune,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
and Egbert gained the victory: but there was a great loss
on both sides; and Hun duke of the province of Somerset
was there slain: he lies buried in the city of Winchester.
Lastly, king Egbert sent his son Ethelwulf with an army<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
into Kent, and with him bishop Ealstan and duke Wulfherd.
They defeated the Kentish army, and pursued their king
Baldred into the northern parts beyond the Thames. To
whom the men of Kent are afterwards subjected, and also
the provinces of Surrey and Sussex, that is, the midland
and southern Angles.</p>

<p>A. 824. For in the course of the same year the king of
the East-Angles with the wise men of his realm, visits king
Egbert, for the sake of peace and protection, on account of
his fear of the Mercians.</p>

<p>A. 825. In the course of that year the aforesaid East-Angles
made war against Bernulf king of the Mercians, and
having defeated his army they slew him and five dukes with
him. His successor was Withlaf.</p>

<p>A. 827. Two years afterwards, the moon was eclipsed on
the very night of Christ's nativity. And in the same year
king Egbert reduced under his power all that part of the
kingdom which lies to the south of the river Humber: he
was the eighth king in Britain who was famous for his great
power. For the first was &AElig;lla king of the South-Angles,
who possessed the same dominions as Egbert; the second
was Ceawlin king of the West-Angles; the third Ethelbert
king of Kent; the fourth Redwald king of the East-Angles;
the fifth Edwin king of Northumbria; the sixth Oswald;
the seventh Oswy brother of Oswald; after whom the eighth
Egbert, of whom we have made mention above. He led his
army against the Northumbrians, who also bent their necks
and submitted to him.</p>

<p>A. 828. At the end of a year therefore, Withlaf again
received the kingdom. At that time also, king Egbert led
his army against the northern Britons, and when he had subdued
all of them, he returned in peace.</p>

<p>A. 832. After four years therefore the pagans devastated
the territories of a place called Sceapige.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>A. 833. After one year Egbert fought against the pagan
fleet, in number thirty-five vessels, at a place called Carrum
[Charmouth]: and the Danes obtained the victory.</p>

<p>A. 836. Lastly after three years, a large army of Britons
approached the frontiers of the West-Saxons: without de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>lay
they form themselves into a compact body, and carry
their arms against Egbert king of the Angles. Egbert
therefore having ascertained the state of things beforehand,
assembled his army and twice imbued their weapons in the
blood of the Britons at Hengeston,<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> and put them to flight.</p>

<p>A. 837. At the end of a year the powerful king Egbert
died.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. III.</span>&mdash;<i>Of the reign of Ethelwulf and of his deeds.</i></h3>


<p>After his death, Athulf<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> succeeded to the throne of his
father Egbert, and he delivered up the kingdom of Kent to
his son Athelstan, together with East-Saxony, South-Saxony,
and Surrey, i.e. the eastern, southern and midland parts.</p>

<p>A. 838. After one year, duke Wulfherd fought with the
pagan fleet near the town of Hamptun [Southampton],
and having slain many of them gained the victory: the
number of ships in the fleet was thirty-three. After this
exploit the duke himself died in peace. The same year
duke Ethelhelm, with the people of the province of Dorset,
fought another battle against the pagan army at Port, and
pursued them some distance: but afterwards the Danes
were victorious, and slew the duke and his companions with
him.</p>

<p>A. 839. After one year duke Herebert was slain by the
Danes at Merswarum;<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> and the same year a great slaughter
was made by that army in the city of Lindsey, and in the
province of Kent, and in East Anglia.</p>

<p>A. 840. Also after one year, the same thing took place in
the city of London, in Quintanwic [Canterbury], and in the
town of Rochester.</p>

<p>A. 841. Meanwhile, after one year king Ethelwulf fought
against the Danes at a place called Charmouth, by whom also
he was vanquished, and the victors kept possession of the
ground.</p>

<p>A. 844. Three years afterwards duke Eanwulf, who
governed the province of Somerset, and bishop Ealstan
also, and Osric duke of Dorset, fought a battle against the
pagans at the mouth of the Parret before-mentioned; where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
they gained the victory, having defeated the Danish army.
Also in the same year king Athelstan and duke Elchere
fought against the army of the above-mentioned nation in
the province of Kent, near the town of Sandwich, where
they slew many of them, put their troops to flight, and took
nine ships.</p>

<p>A. 851. After seven years Ceorl duke of Devon fought a
battle against the pagans at Wembury,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> where they slew many
of the Danes and gained the victory. In the course of the
same year, the barbarians wintered first in the isle of Thanet,
which lies not far from Britain, and has fruitful but not large
corn fields. That year was not yet finished, when a large fleet
of pagans arrived, 350 ships, at the mouth of the river
Thames, commonly called Thames-mouth, and destroyed the
city of Canterbury and the city of London, and put to flight
Berthwulf king of Mercia, having defeated his army. After
the battle they returned beyond the river Thames towards
the south through the province of Surrey, and there king
Ethelwulf with the Western Angles met them: an immense
number was slain on both sides, nor have we ever heard of a
more severe battle before that day: these things happened
near Ockley Wood.</p>

<p>A. 854. After three years king Burhred asked assistance
from king Ethelwulf to subdue the Northern Britons: he
granted it, and having collected his army, passed through
the Mercian kingdom to go against the Britons: whom he
subdued and made tributary. In the same year king
Ethelwulf sent his son Alfred to Rome, in the days of our
lord pope Leo,<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> who consecrated him king and named him
his son in baptism, when we are accustomed to name little
children, when we receive them from the bishop's hand. In
the same year were fought battles in the isle of Thanet
against the pagans; and there was a great slaughter made
on both sides, and many were drowned in the sea. The
same year also after Easter king Ethelwulf gave his daughter
in marriage to king Burhred.</p>

<p>A. 855. After a year the pagans wintered in Sheppey. In
the same year king Ethelwulf gave the tenth of all his
possessions to be the Lord's portion, and so appointed it to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
be in all the government of his kingdom. In the same year
he set out to Rome with great dignity, and stayed there
twelve months. As he returned home, therefore, to his
country, Charles, king of the Franks, gave him his daughter
in marriage, and he took her home with him to his own
country.</p>

<p>A. 857. Lastly, after a year king Ethelwulf died, and his
body reposes in the city of Winchester. Now the aforesaid
king was son of king Egbert, and his grandfather was
Elmund, his great-grandfather Eafa, his great-grandfather's
father was Eoppa, and his great-grandfather's grandfather
was Ingild, brother of Ina, king of the Western-Angles, who
ended his life at Rome; and the above-named kings derived
their origin from king Kenred. Kenred was the son of
Ceolwald, son of Cuthwin, son of Ceawlin, son of Cynric,
son of Cerdic, who also was the first possessor of the
western parts of Britain, after he had defeated the armies of
the Britons: his father was Elesa, son of Esla, son of Gewis,
son of Wig, son of Freawin, son of Frithogar, son of Brond,
son of Beldeg, son of Woden, son of Frithowald, son of
Frealaf, son of Frithuwulf, son of Finn, son of Godwulf, son
of Geat, son of T&aelig;twa, son of Beaw, son of Sceldi, son of
Sceaf. This Sceaf came with one ship to an island of the
ocean named Scani, sheathed in arms, and he was a young
boy, and unknown to the people of that land; but he was
received by them, and they guarded him as their own with
much care, and afterwards chose him for their king. It is
from him that king Ethelwulf derives his descent. And
then was completed the fiftieth year from the beginning of
king Egbert's reign.</p>

<h4>HERE ENDS THE THIRD BOOK,<br /><br />

AND THE PROLOGUE OF THE FOURTH BOOK HERE BEGINS.</h4>


<p>Three books are now finished, and it remains to guide my
pen to the fourth, in which also will be found greater gain,
and the origin of our race is more clearly intimated. And,
although I may seem to send you a load of reading, dearest
sister of my desire, do not judge me harshly, but as my
writings were in love to you, so may you read them.</p>

<p>And may God Almighty, who is praised both in Trinity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
and in Unipotence ever preserve you under the shadow of
his wings, and your companions with you. Amen!</p>

<h4>HERE ENDS THE PROLOGUE.</h4>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. I.</span>&mdash;<i>Of the reign of the sons of king Ethelwulf, namely Ethelbald
and Ethelbert.</i></h3>


<p>Meanwhile, after the death of king Ethelwulf, his sons were
raised to the kingdom, namely Ethelbald over the Western
Angles, and Ethelbert over the men of Kent, and the
Eastern, Southern, and Midland Angles.</p>

<p>A. 861. When five years were completed, king Ethelbald
died, and his brother Ethelbert succeeded to the possessions
of both. In those days a large fleet of pagans came to land,
and destroyed the royal city which is called Winton. They
were encountered by Osric duke of Hampshire, and Ethelwulf
duke of Berkshire: a battle ensued; the pagans were
routed, and the English gained the victory.</p>

<p>A. 865. After four years, from the death of king Ethelbald,
the pagans strengthened their position in the isle of
Thanet, and promise to be at peace with the men of Kent,
who on their part prepare money, ignorant of the future.
But the Danes break their compact, and sallying out
privately by night, lay waste all the eastern coast of Kent.</p>

<p>A. 866. After one year king Ethelbert died, and his body
rests peaceably in the monastery named Sherborne.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. II.</span>&mdash;<i>Of the reign of king Ethelred.</i></h3>


<p>Ethelred succeeded to the throne after the death of his
brother Ethelbert. In the same year the fleets of the tyrant
Hingwar arrived in England from the north, and wintered
among the East Angles, and having established their arms
there, they get on their horses, and make peace with all the
inhabitants in their own neighbourhood.</p>

<p>A. 867. After one year that army, leaving the eastern
parts, crossed the river Humber into Northumberland to the
city of Evoric, which is now commonly called the city of
Eoferwic [York]. For there was then a great civil dissension
between the inhabitants of that land, and they were so
enraged that they also expelled their king Osbert from his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
seat; and having confirmed their resolves, they chose an
obscure person for their king; and after some delay they
turned their thoughts to raise an army and repulse those who
were advancing. They collected together no small bodies of
troops, and reconnoitred the enemy: their rage was excited:
they joined battle, a miserable slaughter took place on both
sides, and the kings were slain. Those of them who were
left made peace with the hostile army.</p>

<p>In the same year died Eanwulf, duke of Somerset; also
bishop Ealstan, fifty years after his succession to the bishopric,
in the diocese called Sherborne. There also his body
now reposes; and that of the above-named duke in the
monastery called Glastonbury.</p>

<p>A. 868. After one year therefore, the army of the pagans,
of whose arrival we have spoken above, measured out their
camp in a place called Snotingaham [Nottingham], and there
they passed the winter, and Burhred king of the Mercians,
with his nobles, consented to their remaining there without
reproach.</p>

<p>A. 869. At the end of a year therefore, the army was
transported to York, and there also they measured out their
camp in the winter season.</p>

<p>A. 870. Again after a year they departed, and passed
through Mercia into East-Anglia, and there measured out
their camp for the winter at Thetford. King Edmund carried
on war against them for a short time, but he was slain
there by them, and his body lies entombed at a place called
Beodoricsworthe,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> and the barbarians obtained the victory,
but with the loss of their king soon afterwards: for king
Hingwar died the same year; archbishop Ceolnoth also died
that same year, and is buried in the city of Canterbury.</p>

<p>A. 871. After one year therefore the army of the barbarians
above-mentioned set out for Reading, and the principal
object of the impious crew was to attack the West-Saxons;
and three days after they came, their two consuls, forgetting
that they were not on board their fleet, rode proudly through
fields and meadows on horseback, which nature had denied
to them.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p><p>But duke Ethelwulf met them, and though his troops were
few, their hearts resided in brave dwellings: they point
their darts, they rout the enemy, and triumph in abundant
spoils. At length four days after their meeting, Ethelred
arrives with his army; an indescribable battle is fought,
now these, now those urge on the fight with spears immoveable;
duke Ethelwulf falls, who a short time before had
obtained the victory: the barbarians at last triumph. The
body of the above-named duke is privately withdrawn, and
carried into the province of the Mercians, to a place called
Northworthig, but Derby in the language of the Danes.
Four days after king Ethelred with his brother Alfred fought
again with all the army of the Danes at &AElig;scendune;<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> and
there was great slaughter on both sides: but at last king
Ethelred obtained the victory. But it is proper that I should
declare the names of those chiefs who fell there: Bagsac
king, the veteran Sidrac their consul, the younger Sidrac
also, the consul Osbern, the consul Frene, the consul Harold;
and, so to speak, all the flower of the barbarian youth was
there slain, so that neither before nor since was ever such
destruction known since the Saxons first gained Britain by
their arms.</p>

<p>Fourteen days after, they again took courage and a second
battle was fought at a place called Basing: the barbarians
came and took part over against them; the fight began, and
hope passed from the one side to the other; the royal
army was deceived, the enemy had the victory, but gained no
spoils.</p>

<p>Furthermore after two months the aforesaid king Ethelred
renewed the battle, and with him was his brother Alfred, at
Merton, against all the army of the barbarians, and a large
number was slain on both sides. The barbarians obtained
the victory; bishop Heahmund there fell by the sword, and
his body lies buried at C&aelig;gineshamme.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Many others also
fell or fled in that battle, concerning whom it seems to be a
loss of time to speak more minutely at present. Lastly,
after the above-mentioned battle, and after the Easter of the
same year, died king Ethelred, from whose family I derive
my origin.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p><p>And now I have followed up my plan, dear cousin Matilda,
and will begin to consolidate my subject; and like a ship
which, having sailed a long way over the waves, already
occupies the port, to which in her patient voyage she had
been tending: so we, like sailors, are already entering, and
as I briefly intimated to you in my former epistle, so also in
the prefaces to this present book, and without any impropriety
I again remind you, and though I cut short the course
of that which is visionary, not impelled by necessity, but
through love of your affection, I now send it you again more
fully to be meditated upon concerning the origin of our
family, and sufficiently embrace the study of your sincerity.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>Thus far then: I will now leave obscurity and begin to
speak concerning the sons of Ethelwulf. They were five in
number: the first was Ethelstan, who also shared the kingdom
with his father: the second was Ethelbald, who also
was king of the Western English: the third was Ethelbert,
king of Kent: the fourth was Ethelred, who after the death
of Ethelbert succeeded to the kingdom, and was also my
grandfather's grandfather: the fifth was Alfred, who succeeded
after all the others to the whole sovereignty, and was
your grandfather's grandfather. Wherefore I make known
to you, my beloved cousin Matilda, that I receive these things
from ancient tradition, and have taken care in most brief
style to write the history of our race down to these two
kings, from whom we have taken our origin. To you therefore,
most beloved, I devote this work, compelled by the love
of our relationship: if others receive them with haughtiness,
they will be judged unworthy of the feast; if otherwise, we
advise all in charity to gather what is set before them. Let
us return then to the story that we broke off, and to the
death of the above-named Ethelred. His reign lasted five
years, and he is buried in the monastery which goes by the
name of Wimborne.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. III.</span>&mdash;<i>Of the reign of king Alfred.</i></h3>


<p>A. 871. After these things, Alfred obtained the kingdom
when his brothers were dead,&mdash;he also was the youngest son
of king Ethelwulf&mdash;over all the provinces of Britain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>There came a summer-army innumerable to Reading, and
were eager to fight against the army of the West-Angles: to
their aid also came those who had already long time been
ravaging. But the army of the Angles at that time was
small on account of the king's absence, who at the same time
had performed his brother's obsequies, and although their
ranks were not full, yet their hearts were firm in their
breasts, they rejoice in the fight, and repel the enemy: but
at length oppressed with fatigue, they cease from the fight.
The barbarians hold possession of a sterile field of battle:
afterwards also they spread themselves and ravage the
country. During their foul domination, there were three
battles fought by the Angles, besides the battles before-mentioned,
and eleven of their consuls, whom they call
"earls," were slain, and one of their kings. Lastly, in the
same year the Eastern Angles made peace with them. And
the number of years to the encamping of the barbarian
army in Reading and to the death of king Ethelred and the
succession of his brother Alfred was the seventy-first from
the time that Egbert had first consolidated the kingdom, and
forty-seven from the time that the Mercians and Western
Angles carried on civil wars at the place called Ellandune,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
and king Egbert received the name of victor twenty-six
years from the time that the battle was fought in Pedredan
[Petherton]; and twenty years after the contest which was
waged near the wood called Ockley, and lastly five years
from the arrival of the pagans in the country of the East
Angles: and without long delay, they then went to Reading.</p>

<p>A. 872. After a year had elapsed from the time of their
coming to Reading, they measured out their camp in the
neighbourhood of the city of London. But the Mercians
ratify a treaty with them, and pay a stipend.</p>

<p>A. 873. After one year the barbarians change their
position to the neighbourhood of the city of Lindsey in a
place called Torksey. The Mercian people renew their
treaty with them.</p>

<p>A. 874. After the lapse of a year, the barbarians at length
remove to a place called Repton, and drive king Burhred
from the kingdom beyond the sea. Twenty and two years<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
are enumerated from the time that he first occupied his
father's kingdom. They now break the peace, and devastate
the lands of the Mercians. The above-named king did not
abandon his hope in Christ, but made a journey to Rome and
died there, and his body, laid in a worthy mausoleum, reposes
in the temple of Christ's blessed mother, which is now called
the school of the English. At the same time Ceolwulf
possessed the kingdom of the Mercians.</p>

<p>A. 875. Lastly after a year, the barbarians divide the
kingdom into two parts: and Halfdene the leader of the
barbarians took one part, namely the kingdom of the
Northumbrians, and there he chose his winter-quarters near
the river called the Tyne, and they ravaged the country
there on every side. But they also made frequent wars on
the Picts and the men of Cumberland. Oskytel also, and
Gothrun, and Anwiund, their three kings, with an immense
army, came from Repton to a place called Grantabridge
[Cambridge], and there remained twelve months. Furthermore
in the summer of the same year, king Alfred came out
with his army on board a fleet by sea, and the barbarians
met them with seven tall vessels. A battle ensues, and
the Danes are routed: the king takes one of their ships.</p>

<p>A. 876. After one year, the tyrant Halfdene obtained the
kingdom of the Northumbrians, all of whom he reduced to
subjection. And in the course of the same year, the army
which had been at Cambridge made a junction with the
western army, a thing which they had not done before, near
the town which is called Wareham, and ravaged the greater
part of that province. Also the king ratified a treaty of
peace with them and gave them money. But they gave him
hostages chosen out of their army, and made oath to him on
their sacred bracelet which they had never done to the kings
of the other districts, that they would quickly leave their
territories.</p>

<p>A. 877. But they broke the peace and contravened their
engagements, and the following year extended their troops
into the province of Devon, where they passed the winter at
Exeter. Lastly their fleets put to sea and spread their sails
to the wind: but a lamentable storm came on, and the
greatest part of them, namely a hundred of their chief ships,
were sunk near the rock which is called Swanwich. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
barbarians renew their fraud and offer peace: hostages were
given, more than were demanded, to the effect that they would
withdraw out of the territories of king Alfred; and they did
so. They devastate the kingdom of the Mercians and drive
out all the free men. They erect their huts in the town of
Gloucester.</p>

<p>A. 878. At the end of that year therefore this foul mob
broke the compact which they had before solemnly made with
the Western Angles, and they take up their winter-quarters
at Chippenham. The people were everywhere unable to
resist: some of them were driven by the impious wretches
over the sea into Gaul. King Alfred was at this time
straitened more than was becoming. Ethelnoth also duke of
Somerset lived with a narrow retinue in a certain wood, and
they built a stronghold in the island of Athelingay,<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> which
seems to have been situated in a marsh. But the aforesaid
king fought daily battles against the barbarians, having with
him the province of Somerset only; no others assisted him,
except the servants who made use of the king's pastures. In
the same year arrived Halfdene brother of the tyrant
Hingwar with thirty galleys, in the western parts of the
Angles, and besieged Odda duke of Devon in a certain
castle, and war was stirred up on all sides. The king of the
barbarians fell, and eighty decads with him. At last the
Danes obtain the victory.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, after the Easter<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> of that year, king Alfred
fought against the army that was in Chippenham, at a place
called Ethandune,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> and they obtain the victory. But after
the decision of the battle, the barbarians promise peace, ask
a truce, give hostages, and bind themselves by oath: their
king submits to be baptized, and Alfred the king receives
him from the laver in the marshy isle of Alney.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Duke
Ethelnoth also purified the same at a place called Wedmore,
and king Alfred there bestowed upon him magnificent
honors.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p><p>A. 879. After a year from the time of the pagan army
leaving Gloucester, they marched to Cirencester, and there
wintered. In the course of the same year the sun was
eclipsed.</p>

<p>A. 880. A year after the eclipse, the aforesaid army
struck their tents, and leaving Cirencester went into the
country of the East Angles, and pitching their camp, reduced
all the inhabitants of those parts to subjection. And
it was now fourteen years since the barbarians first wintered
in the country aforesaid, and ravaged it. In the same year,
when they had reduced the district aforesaid, they went in
a vessel to Gaul and took up a position at a place called
Ghent: the same men who had formerly measured out their
camp at a place called Fulham.</p>

<p>A. 881. After a year, they attempt to proceed further;
but the armies of the Franks assail them and gain the victory;
the barbarians were put to flight.</p>

<p>A. 882. After a year the aforesaid army passed into the
upper districts of the Maese and measured out their camp at
a place called Escelum.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> In the same year king Alfred
put to sea and fell in with four ships; which he defeated,
and destroyed two, the others surrendered.</p>

<p>A. 883. The next year the aforesaid army entered the
parishes of the Scald,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> to a place called Cundath;<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> and
there measured out their camp for the winter.</p>

<p>A. 884. After one year had expired, that pestilential
army aforesaid removed to the higher districts of the Somme,
to a place called Embenum,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> and there wintered.</p>

<p>A. 885. After a year they divide themselves into two
parts: one to Sofenum,<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> the other to Rochester; and they
laid siege to those towns. They also construct other smaller
camps. Defeat prevails among the inhabitants until the arrival
of king Alfred with an army. The foul plague was
vanquished, and sought reinforcement....<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Some of them
made for the sea-coasts. The same year they renewed their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
league, and gave hostages to the English, and twice in the
year they counted the spoil which they had obtained by
fraud, in the land which borders on the southern bank of
the Thames. The filthy crew which were then in possession
of the East Angles, suddenly removed to a place called Bamfleet;
and there the allied band divided; some of them remained,
and some of them went beyond the sea. In the
same year, therefore, the aforesaid king Alfred sent his fleet
into the country of the East Angles, and immediately on
their arrival, there met them at a place called Stourmouth
sixteen ships, which they forthwith ravaged, and slew the
captains with the sword. The rest of the pirate-crew met
them; they ply their oars, their armour shines over the constrained
waters, the barbarians obtain the victory. In the
same year died Charles the Magnificent king of the Franks,
cut off by death before the revolution of one year; after him
came his uterine brother who ruled over the western coasts
of Gaul. Both were sons of Louis, who had formerly possessed
the sole sovereignty: his life had reached its termination
during the eclipse of the sun aforesaid. He was son of
the great king Charles, whose daughter Ethelwulf king of
the English had taken to wife. In the course of that year,
a great number of barbarians landed and filled the coasts of
the Old Saxons; two battles were fought soon after: the
Saxons were the victors, and the Frisons also were present
in the contest. In the same year Charles the Younger succeeded
to the sovereignty of all the western parts of Gaul as
far as the Tyrrhenian sea, and, if I may so speak, of the
dominions of his grandfather, except the province of the
Lidwiccas.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> His father was Lodwicus, brother of the middle
Charles whose daughter was married to Ethelwulf king of
the English. And both of these were sons of Lodwicus,
namely, Lodwicus was son of Charlemagne who was the
son of Pepin.</p>

<p>In the same year died the blessed pope Martin,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> who also
gave freedom to the school of the English, by the appointment
of king Alfred, and sent as a present part of the thrice blessed
cross of Christ, who is the salvation of the world. In the
course of that year, the above-named pestilential crew broke
their engagements, and marched in arms against king Alfred.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Lastly, after a year, they went to the lower parts of Gaul,
and fixed on a place to winter near the river Seine. Meanwhile,
the city of London was fortified by king Alfred, whom
no civil discord could subdue, either by cunning or by force:
all men received him as a saviour, and particularly the Saxons&mdash;except
the barbarians&mdash;and those who were then held
prisoners in their hands. Also, after his army was strengthened,
Ethered was appointed leader there by the aforesaid
king, to guard the citadel.</p>

<p>A. 887. Now the army which were at that time ravaging
the country of Gaul cut their way through the bridge of the
citadel of Paris, and devastated the whole country along the
Seine, as far as the Marne, and above its vertex, as far as
Catsig [Chezy], where they thrice fixed their winter quarters.
In the same year also died Charles, king of the Franks, and his
cousin Arnulf succeeded to the kingdom, seven years before
his uncle's death. The kingdom was then divided into five,
and so many kings in the same: but all things are done by
the permission of king Arnulf, and they promised to be all
under his subjection, because they were not like him, descended
from the paternal stock; and he lived after this on
the eastern side of the river Rhine. But Rodulf occupied
the middle parts of the kingdom, Oda the western parts, and
Beorngar with Witha held the kingdom of the Lombards
from the division of the Jovian mountain.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> There they
began a civil war; people assailed people; the lands of both
were continually disturbed, nor was there any hope of quiet.</p>

<p>The same year, in which the barbarians had settled on the
bridge of Paris, duke Ethelhelm received no small part of the
money paid from the diocese of the English by the king for
the people, and went to Rome. In the same year died
queen Ethelswith.</p>

<p>A. 888. In the lapse of the same year also, archbishop
Athelred deceased, and Ethelwold, commander in Kent.</p>

<p>A. 889. After one year, abbat Bernhelm carried to Rome
the alms for the people, and principally those of the western
English and of king Alfred. Then also Gothrun, king of
the northern English, yielded his breath to Orcus; he had
taken the name of Athelstan, as he came out of the baptismal
laver, from his godfather, king Alfred, and had his seat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
among the East-Angles, since he there also had held the
first station.</p>

<p>In the same year, the aforesaid army of barbarians removed
from the river Seine to a place called Santlaudah,<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
situated between the Bretons and the Franks; but the Bretons
met them in arms, and obtained the victory, and followed
them to the windings of a certain river, and there not a few
of them were drowned in the waters.</p>

<p>A. 891. One year afterwards, the bands of the aforesaid
army visited the eastern parts of France; king Arnulf met
them; a fight of cavalry took place before the fleets arrived.
An army of eastern Franks came up, Saxons and Bavarians;
the pagans spread their sails to flee. In the same year,
three chosen men of Hibernian race, burning with piety,
leave their country: they privately form a boat by sewing
ox-hides; they put into it provisions for a week; they sail
seven days and seven nights, and arrive on the shores of
Cornwall: here they left their fleet, which had been guided,
not by the strength of their arms, but by the power of Him
who rules all things, and set out for the court of king Alfred,
who with his senate rejoice in their coming. From thence
they proceed to Rome, and, as is customary with teachers of
Christ, they essay to go thence to Jerusalem:<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> ... Their
names were, Dubslane, the first; Macbeth, the second;
Maelinmun, the third, flourishing in the arts, skilled in letters,
and a distinguished master of the Scots. Also in the
same year, after Easter a comet appeared, which some think
to be an omen of foul times, which have already past; but it
is the most approved theory of philosophers, that they foretel
future things, as has been tried in many ways.</p>

<p>A. 893. One year after the barbarians fought against king
Arnulf, they go to Boulogne, and there build a fleet, and pass
over into England. There they station their fleet in the Limnean
port, at a place called Apoldre [Appledore, in the eastern
part of Kent,] and destroy an ancient castle, because there
was but a small band of rustics within, and there they make
their winter camp. In the course of this year, a large fleet belonging
to Hasten arrives on the banks of the river Thames,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
and found a citadel on the coasts of Kent, at a place called
Middleton [Milton]: they encamp there the whole winter;
and the number of years that had elapsed from the glorious
nativity of our Saviour was nine hundred, all but seven.</p>

<p>After the Easter of that year, the army which had come
from Gaul leave their camp, and trace the intricacies of a
certain immense wood, which is called Andred, and they extend
as far as the Western Angles. Slowly as they go, they
ravage the adjoining provinces, Hampshire and Berkshire:
these things were told to the heir of Edward, son of king
Alfred, who had been exercising himself in the southern
parts of England. After this they reach the Western Angles,
who meet them with threatening arms and dense array
at Farnham: they exult, freed by the arrival of the prince, like
sheep under the protection of the shepherd; the tyrant is
wounded, and his troops are driven across the river Thames
into the northern countries.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Danes are held besieged in Thorney isle.
Earl Ethered, setting out from the city of London, lent his
aid to the prince. The barbarians asked peace and a treaty:
hostages are given, they promise by oath to leave the kingdom
of the aforesaid king; their words and deeds agree together
without delay. Lastly, they set out for the country
of the East-Angles, formerly governed by the king Saint
Edmund, and their ships fly round to them from the Limnean
port to Meresige [Mersey], a place in Kent.</p>

<p>In the course of the same year, Hasten breaks away with
his band from Bamfleet, and devastates all Mercia, until they
arrive at the end of Britain. The army, which was then in
the eastern part of the country, supplied them with reinforcements,
and the Northumbrian, in the same way. The illustrious
duke Ethelm, with a squadron of cavalry, and duke
Ethelnoth, with an army of Western-Angles, followed behind
them, and Ethered, earl of the Mercians, pressed after
them with great impetuosity. The youth of both people
join battle, and the Angles obtain the victory. These things
are said by ancient writers to have been done at Buttington,
and the exertions of the Danes appeared futile; they again
ratify peace, give hostages, and promise to leave that part of
the country. In the same year Danaasuda,<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> in Bamfleet, was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
destroyed by the people, and they divide the treasure among
them.</p>

<p>After this, Sigeferth, the pirate, lands from his fleet in
Northumbria, and twice devastates the coast, after which he
returns home.</p>

<p>A. 895. When two years were completed, from the time
that an immense fleet came from Boulogne to Limn&aelig;, a town
of the Angles, duke Ethelnoth set out from the western
parts of the Angles, and goes from the city of York against
the enemy, who devastate no small tracts of land in the kingdom
of the Mercians, on the west of Stanford; <i>i.e.</i> between
the courses of the river Weolod<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> and a thick wood, called
Ceoftefne.</p>

<p>A. 896. In the course of one year also, died Guthfrid,
king of the Northumbrians, on the birthday of Christ's
apostle, St. Bartholomew, whose body is buried at York, in
the high church.</p>

<p>A. 900. Meanwhile, after four years, from the time that
the above-named king died, there was a great discord among
the English, because the foul bands of the Danes still remained
throughout Northumberland. Lastly, in the same
year, king Alfred departed out of this world, that immoveable
pillar of the Western Saxons, that man full of justice,
bold in arms, learned in speech, and, above all other things,
imbued with the divine instructions. For he had translated
into his own language, out of Latin, unnumbered volumes, of
so varied a nature, and so excellently, that the sorrowful
book of Boethius seemed, not only to the learned, but even
to those who heard it read, as it were, brought to life again.
The monarch died on the seventh day before the solemnity
of All Saints, and his body rests in peace in the city of Winton.
Pray, O reader, to Christ our Redeemer, that he will
save his soul!</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. IV.</span>&mdash;<i>Of the reign of king Edward, and of his wars.</i></h3>


<p>A. 901. The successor to the throne was Edward, son of
the above-named king. He was elected by the nobles, and
crowned with the royal crown on Whitsunday, one hundred
years having elapsed since his great grandfather, Egbert,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
had gained his present territories. In the same year Ethelbald
received, in the city of London, the bishopric of the
city of York; and, it appears, that the number of years completed,
since Christ came in the flesh, was nine hundred full.</p>

<p>A. 902. After two years was the battle of Holme.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> ...
Five days after the festival of the blessed mother, they
lock together their shields, brandish their swords, and vibrate
their lances in both hands. There fell duke Siwulf
and Sigelm, and almost all the Kentish nobility: and
Eohric, king of the barbarians, there descended to Orcus:
two princes of the English, in the flower of their youth, there
yield up the breath of life, and explore the foreign regions,
under the waves of Acheron, and numbers of full-grown men
fall on both sides. The barbarians remain victors, and triumph
on the field of battle.</p>

<p>A. 905. At length, after three years, the number of years
completed since the beginning of the world, was six thousand
and one hundred.</p>

<p>A. 908. After three years archbishop Plegmund inaugurized,
in the city of Winchester, a lofty tower, which had
been recently founded in honour of Mary, the mother of
God. The pontiff aforesaid, in the course of the same year
carried to Rome the alms for the people, and for king
Edward.</p>

<p>A. 909. After one year the barbarians break their compact
with king Edward, and with earl Ethered, who then ruled
the provinces of Northumberland and Mercia. The lands of
the Mercians are laid waste on all sides by the hosts aforesaid,
as far as the streams of the Avon, where begins the
frontier of the West-Saxons and the Mercians. Thence they
pass over the river Severn into the western regions, and
gained by their devastations no little booty. But when they
had withdrawn homewards, rejoicing in their rich spoils,
they passed over a bridge on the eastern side of the river
Severn, at a place commonly called Cantabridge,<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> the troops
of the Mercians and West-Saxons met them: a battle ensued,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
and in the plain of Wodnesfield the English obtained the
victory: the Danish army fled, overwhelmed by the darts of
their enemies: these things are said to have been done on
the fifth day of August; and their three kings fell there in
that turmoil or battle, namely, Halfdene, Ecwils, and Hingwar:
they lost their sovereignty, and descended to the court
of the infernal king, and their elders and nobles with them.</p>

<p>A. 910. After one year, Ethered, who survived of the
Mercians, departed this life, and was buried peacefully in the
city of Gloucester.</p>

<p>A. 912. After two years, died Athulf in Northumbria;
he was at that time commander of the town called Bebbanburgh.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>A. 913. After a year, a fleet entered the mouth of the
river Severn, but no severe battle was fought there that
year. Lastly, the greater part of that army go to Ireland,
formerly called Bretannis by the great Julius C&aelig;sar.</p>

<p>A. 914. After one year, the day of Christ's nativity fell
on a Sunday; and so great was the tranquillity of that
winter, that no one can remember anything like it either
before or since.</p>

<p>A. 917. After three years, Ethelfled the king's sister
departed this life, and her body lies buried at Gloucester.</p>

<p>A. 926. Also in the ninth year died Edward, king of the
English. This was the end; his name and his pertinacity
here ceased.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. V.</span>&mdash;<i>Of the reign of king Athelstan, his wars and deeds.</i></h3>


<p>A. 926. The year in which the stout king Athelstan
gained the crown of the kingdom, was the nine hundred and
twenty-sixth from the glorious incarnation of our Saviour.</p>

<p>A. 939. Therefore, after thirteen years, a fierce battle was
fought against the barbarians at Brunandune,<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> wherefore that
fight is called great even to the present day: then the
barbarian tribes are defeated and domineer no longer; they
are driven beyond the ocean: the Scots and Picts also bow
the neck; the lands of Britain are consolidated together, on
all sides is peace, and plenty of all things, nor ever did a
fleet again come to land except in friendship with the
English.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. VI.</span>&mdash;<i>Of the reign of king Edmund.</i></h3>


<p>After him Edmund succeeded to the neglected kingdom.</p>

<p>A. 948. After seven years, therefore, bishop Wulfstan and
the duke of the Mercians expelled certain deserters, namely,
Reginald and Anlaf from the city of York, and gave them
into the king's hand. In the same year died also queen
Elfgiva, wife of king Edmund, and afterwards was canonized.
In her tomb, with God's assistance, even to the present day,
miracles are performed in the monastery called Shaftesbury.
In the same period also died king Edmund on the solemnity
of Augustine the Less, who also was the apostle of the
English: and he held the kingdom six years and a half.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. VII.</span>&mdash;<i>Of the reign of king Edred.</i></h3>


<p>Edmund's successor was Edred his brother, to whom all
the Northumbrians became subject; and the Scots also give
oaths of allegiance and immutable fidelity. Not long after
these things he also departed in peace, on the birthday of the
blessed pope and martyr Clement. He had held the kingdom

<h2>ALFRED THE GREAT,</h2>

<h5>FROM A.D. 849 TO A.D. 887.</h5>

<h4>BY ASSER OF SAINT DAVID'S.</h4>


<p>In the year of our Lord's incarnation 849, was born Alfred,
king of the Anglo-Saxons, at the royal village of Wanating,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
in Berkshire, which country has its name from the wood of
Berroc, where the box-tree grows most abundantly. His genealogy
is traced in the following order. King Alfred was the son
of king Ethelwulf, who was the son of Egbert, who was the son
of Elmund, was the son of Eafa, who was the son of Eoppa,
who the son of Ingild. Ingild, and Ina, the famous king
of the West-Saxons, were two brothers. Ina went to Rome,
and there ending this life honourably, entered the heavenly
kingdom, to reign there for ever with Christ. Ingild and
Ina were the sons of Coenred, who was the son of Ceolwald,
who was the son of Cudam, who was the son of Cuthwin,
who was the son of Ceawlin, who was the son of Cynric, who
was the son of Creoda, who was the son of Cerdic, who was
the son of Elesa, who was the son of Gewis, from whom the
Britons name all that nation Gegwis,<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> who was the son of
Brond, who was the son of Beldeg, who was the son of Woden,
who was the son of Frithowald, who was the son of Frealaf,
who was the son of Frithuwulf, who was the son of Finn
of Godwulf, who was the son of Geat, which Geat the pagans
long worshipped as a god. Sedulius makes mention of him
in his metrical Paschal poem, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 6em;">When gentile poets with their fictions vain,<br />
In tragic language and bombastic strain,<br />
To their god Geat, comic deity,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Loud praises sing, &amp;c.</span>
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p><p>Geat was the son of T&aelig;twa, who was the son of Beaw,
who was the son of Sceldi, who was the son of Heremod,
who was the son of Iterinon, who was the son of Hathra,
who was the son of Guala, who was the son of Bedwig, who
was the son of Shem, who was the son of Noah, who was
the son of Lamech, who was the son of Methusalem, who
was the son of Enoch, who was the son of Malaleel, who was
the son of Cainan, who was the son of Enos, who was the
son of Seth, who was the son of Adam.</p>

<p>The mother of Alfred was named Osburga, a religious
woman, noble both by birth and by nature; she was daughter
of Oslac, the famous butler of king Ethelwulf, which
Oslac was a Goth by nation, descended from the Goths and
Jutes, of the seed, namely, of Stuf and Wihtgar, two brothers
and counts: who, having received possession of the Isle of
Wight from their uncle, king Cerdic, and his son Cynric
their cousin, slew the few British inhabitants whom they
could find in that island, at a place called Gwihtgaraburgh;<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
for the other inhabitants of the island had either been slain
or escaped into exile.</p>

<p>In the year of our Lord's incarnation 851, which was the
third after the birth of king Alfred, Ceorl, earl of Devon, fought
with the men of Devon against the pagans at a place called
Wicgambeorg;<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> and the Christians gained the victory; and
that same year the pagans first wintered in the island called
Sheppey, which means the Sheep-isle, and is situated in the
river Thames between Essex and Kent, but is nearer to Kent
than to Essex; it has in it a fine monastery.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>The same year also a great army of the pagans came with
three hundred and fifty ships to the mouth of the river
Thames, and sacked Dorobernia,<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> which is the city of the Cantuarians,
and also the city of London, which lies on the
north bank of the river Thames, on the confines of Essex
and Middlesex; but yet that city belongs in truth to Essex;
and they put to flight Berthwulf, king of Mercia, with all
the army, which he had led out to oppose them.</p>

<p>After these things, the aforesaid pagan host went into
Surrey, which is a district situated on the south bank of
the river Thames, and to the west of Kent. And Ethelwulf,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
king of the West-Saxons, and his son Ethelbald, with all
their army, fought a long time against them at a place called
Ac-lea,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> i.e. the Oak-plain, and there, after a lengthened
battle, which was fought with much bravery on both sides,
the greater part of the pagan multitude was destroyed and
cut to pieces, so that we never heard of their being so defeated,
either before or since, in any country, in one day;
and the Christians gained an honourable victory, and were
triumphant over their graves.</p>

<p>In the same year king Athelstan, son of king Ethelwulf,
and earl Ealhere slew a large army of pagans in Kent, at a
place called Sandwich, and took nine ships of their fleet;
the others escaped by flight.</p>

<p>In the year of our Lord's incarnation 853, which was the
fifth of king Alfred, Burhred, king of the Mercians, sent
messengers, and prayed Ethelwulf, king of the West-Saxons,
to come and help him in reducing the midland Britons, who
dwell between Mercia and the western sea, and who struggled
against him most immoderately. So without delay, king
Ethelwulf, having received the embassy, moved his army,
and advanced with king Burhred against Britain,<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> and immediately,
on entering that country, he began to ravage it; and
having reduced it under subjection to king Burhred, he returned
home.</p>

<p>In the same year, king Ethelwulf sent his son Alfred,
above-named, to Rome, with an honourable escort both of
nobles and commoners. Pope Leo [the fourth] at that time
presided over the apostolic see, and he anointed for king
the aforesaid Alfred, and adopted him as his spiritual son.
The same year also, earl Ealhere, with the men of Kent,
and Huda with the men of Surrey, fought bravely and resolutely
against an army of the pagans, in the island, which
is called in the Saxon tongue, Tenet,<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> but Ruim in the
British language. The battle lasted a long time, and many
fell on both sides, and also were drowned in the water; and
both the earls were there slain. In the same year also, after
Easter, Ethelwulf, king of the West-Saxons, gave his daughter
to Burhred, king of the Mercians, and the marriage was
celebrated royally at the royal vill of Chippenham.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p><p>In the year of our Lord's incarnation 855, which was the
seventh after the birth of the aforesaid king, Edmund the
most glorious king of the East-Angles began to reign, on the
eighth day before the kalends of January, i.e. on the birthday
of our Lord, in the fourteenth year of his age. In
this year also died Lothaire, the Roman emperor, son of the
pious Lewis Augustus. In the same year the aforesaid
venerable king Ethelwulf released the tenth part of all his
kingdom from all royal service and tribute, and with a pen
never to be forgotten, offered it up to God the One and the
Three in One, in the cross of Christ, for the redemption of
his own soul and of his predecessors. In the same year he
went to Rome with much honour; and taking with him his
son, the aforesaid king Alfred, for a second journey thither,
because he loved him more than his other sons, he remained
there a whole year; after which he returned to his own
country, bringing with him Judith, daughter of Charles, the
king of the Franks.</p>

<p>In the meantime, however, whilst king Ethelwulf was residing
beyond the sea, a base deed was done, repugnant to
the morals of all Christians, in the western part of Selwood.
For king Ethelbald [son of king Ethelwulf] and Ealstan,
bishop of the church of Sherborne, with Eanwulf, earl of the
district of Somerton, are said to have made a conspiracy
together, that king Ethelwulf, on his return from Rome,
should never again be received into his kingdom. This crime,
unheard-of in all previous ages, is ascribed by many to the
bishop and earl alone, as resulting from their counsels. Many
also ascribe it solely to the insolence of the king, because
that king was pertinacious in this matter, and in many other
perversities, as we have heard related by certain persons;
as also was proved by the result of that which follows.</p>

<p>For as he was returning from Rome, his son aforesaid, with
all his counsellors, or, as I ought to say, his conspirators,
attempted to perpetrate the crime of repulsing the king from
his own kingdom; but neither did God permit the deed, nor
would the nobles of all Saxony consent to it. For to prevent
this irremediable evil to Saxony, of a son warring against his
father, or rather of the whole nation carrying on civil war
either on the side of the one or the other, the extraordinary
mildness of the father, seconded by the consent of all the
nobles, divided between the two the kingdom which had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
hitherto been undivided; the eastern parts were given to the
father, and the western to the son; for where the father
ought by just right to reign, there his unjust and obstinate
son did reign; for the western part of Saxony is always preferable
to the eastern.</p>

<p>When Ethelwulf, therefore, was coming from Rome, all
that nation, as was fitting, so delighted in the arrival of the
old man, that, if he permitted them, they would have expelled
his rebellious son Ethelbald, with all his counsellors,
out of the kingdom. But he, as we have said, acting with
great clemency and prudent counsel, so wished things to be
done, that the kingdom might not come into danger; and he
placed Judith, daughter of king Charles, whom he had received
from his father, by his own side on the regal throne,
without any controversy or enmity from his nobles, even to
the end of his life, contrary to the perverse custom of that
nation. For the nation of the West-Saxons do not allow a
queen to sit beside the king, nor to be called a queen, but
only the king's wife; which stigma the elders of that land
say arose from a certain obstinate and malevolent queen
of the same nation, who did all things so contrary to her
lord, and to all the people, that she not only earned for herself
exclusion from the royal seat, but also entailed the same
stigma upon those who came after her; for in consequence
of the wickedness of that queen, all the nobles of that land
swore together, that they would never let any king reign over
them, who should attempt to place a queen on the throne by
his side.</p>

<p>And because, as I think, it is not known to many whence
this perverse and detestable custom arose in Saxony, contrary
to the custom of all the Theotiscan nations, it seems to me
right to explain a little more fully what I have heard from
my lord Alfred, king of the Anglo-Saxons, as he also had
heard it from many men of truth, who in great part recorded
that fact.</p>

<p>There was in Mercia, in recent times, a certain valiant
king, who was feared by all the kings and neighbouring
states around. His name was Offa, and it was he who had
the great rampart made from sea to sea between Britain<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> and
Mercia. His daughter, named Eadburga, was married to
Bertric, king of the West-Saxons; who immediately, having<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
the king's affections, and the control of almost all the kingdom,
began to live tyrannically like her father, and to execrate
every man whom Bertric loved, and to do all things hateful
to God and man, and to accuse all she could before the king,
and so to deprive them insidiously of their life or power;
and if she could not obtain the king's consent, she used to
take them off by poison: as is ascertained to have been the
case with a certain young man beloved by the king, whom she
poisoned, finding that the king would not listen to any accusation
against him. It is said, moreover, that king Bertric
unwittingly tasted of the poison, though the queen intended
to give it to the young man only, and so both of them
perished.</p>

<p>Bertric therefore being dead, the queen could remain no
longer among the West-Saxons, but sailed beyond the sea
with immense treasures, and went to the court of the great
and famous Charles, king of the Franks. As she stood
before the throne, and offered him money, Charles said to
her, "Choose, Eadburga, between me and my son, who stands
here with me." She replied, foolishly, and without deliberation,
"If I am to have my choice, I choose your son, because
he is younger than you." At which Charles smiled
and answered, "If you had chosen me, you would have
had my son; but as you have chosen him, you shall not
have either of us."</p>

<p>However, he gave her a large convent of nuns, in which,
having laid aside the secular habit and taken the religious
dress, she discharged the office of abbess during a few years;
for, as she is said to have lived irrationally in her own country,
so she appears to have acted still more so in that foreign
country; for being convicted of having had unlawful intercourse
with a man of her own nation, she was expelled from
the monastery by king Charles's order, and lived a vicious life
of reproach in poverty and misery until her death; so that
at last, accompanied by one slave only, as we have heard
from many who saw her, she begged her bread daily at Pavia,
and so miserably died.</p>

<p>Now king Ethelwulf lived two years after his return from
Rome; during which, among many other good deeds of this
present life, reflecting on his departure according to the way
of all flesh, that his sons might not quarrel unreasonably
after their father's death, he ordered a will or letter of in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>structions
to be written, in which he ordered that his kingdom
should be divided between his two eldest sons, his
private inheritance between his sons, his daughters, and his
relations, and the money which he left behind him between
his sons and nobles, and for the good of his soul. Of this
prudent policy we have thought fit to record a few instances out
of many for posterity to imitate; namely, such as are understood
to belong principally to the needs of the soul; for the
others, which relate only to human dispensation, it is not
necessary to insert in this work, lest prolixity should create
disgust in those who read or wish to hear my work. For the
benefit of his soul, then, which he studied to promote in all
things from the first flower of his youth, he directed through
all his hereditary dominions, that one poor man in ten, either
native or foreigner, should be supplied with meat, drink, and
clothing, by his successors, until the day of judgment; supposing,
however, that the country should still be inhabited
both by men and cattle, and should not become deserted.
He commanded also a large sum of money, namely, three
hundred mancuses, to be carried to Rome for the good of his
soul, to be distributed in the following manner: namely, a
hundred mancuses in honour of St. Peter, specially to buy
oil for the lights of the church of that apostle on Easter eve,
and also at the cock-crow: a hundred mancuses in honour of
St. Paul, for the same purpose of buying oil for the church of
St. Paul the apostle, to light the lamps on Easter eve and at
the cock-crow; and a hundred mancuses for the universal
apostolic pontiff.</p>

<p>But when king Ethelwulf was dead, and buried at Stemrugam,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
his son Ethelbald, contrary to God's prohibition and
the dignity of a Christian, contrary also to the custom of all
the pagans, ascended his father's bed, and married Judith,
daughter of Charles, king of the Franks, and drew down
much infamy upon himself from all who heard of it. During
two years and a half of licentiousness after his father he held
the government of the West-Saxons.</p>

<p>In the year of our Lord's incarnation 856, which was the
eighth after Alfred's birth, the second year of king Charles
III, and the eighteenth year of the reign of Ethelwulf,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
king of the West-Saxons, Humbert, bishop of the East-Angles,
anointed with oil and consecrated as king the glorious
Edmund, with much rejoicing and great honour in the
royal town called Burva, in which at that time was the royal
seat, in the fifteenth year of his age, on a Friday, the twenty-fourth
moon, being Christmas-day.</p>

<p>In the year of our Lord's incarnation 860, which was the
twelfth of king Alfred's age, died Ethelbald, king of the
West-Saxons, and was buried at Sherborne. His brother
Ethelbert, as was fitting, joined Kent, Surrey, and Sussex
also to his dominion.</p>

<p>In his days a large army of pagans came from the sea,
and attacked and destroyed the city of Winchester. As they
were returning laden with booty to their ships, Osric,
earl of Hampshire, with his men, and earl Ethelwulf, with
the men of Berkshire, confronted them bravely; a severe
battle took place, and the pagans were slain on every side;
and, finding themselves unable to resist, took to flight like
women, and the Christians obtained a triumph.</p>

<p>Ethelbert governed his kingdom five years in peace, with
the love and respect of his subjects, who felt deep sorrow
when he went the way of all flesh. His body was honourably
interred at Sherborne by the side of his brothers.</p>

<p>In the year of our Lord's incarnation 864, the pagans
wintered in the isle of Thanet, and made a firm treaty with
the men of Kent, who promised them money for adhering to
their covenant; but the pagans, like cunning foxes, burst
from their camp by night, and setting at naught their engagements,
and spurning at the promised money, which they
knew was less than they could get by plunder, they ravaged
all the eastern coast of Kent.</p>

<p>In the year of our Lord's incarnation 866, which was the
eighteenth of king Alfred, Ethelred, brother of Ethelbert,
king of the West Saxons, undertook the government of the
kingdom for five years; and the same year a large fleet of
pagans came to Britain from the Danube, and wintered in the
kingdom of the Eastern-Saxons, which is called in Saxon
East-Anglia; and there they became principally an army of
cavalry. But, to speak in nautical phrase, I will no longer
commit my vessel to the power of the waves and of its sails,
or keeping off from land steer my round-about course through
so many calamities of wars and series of years, but will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
return to that which first prompted me to this task; that is to
say, I think it right in this place briefly to relate as much as
has come to my knowledge about the character of my revered
lord Alfred, king of the Anglo-Saxons, during the years that
he was an infant and a boy.</p>

<p>He was loved by his father and mother, and even by all
the people, above all his brothers, and was educated altogether
at the court of the king. As he advanced through
the years of infancy and youth, his form appeared more
comely than that of his brothers; in look, in speech, and in
manners he was more graceful than they. His noble nature
implanted in him from his cradle a love of wisdom above all
things; but, with shame be it spoken, by the unworthy
neglect of his parents and nurses, he remained illiterate even
till he was twelve years old or more; but he listened with
serious attention to the Saxon poems which he often heard
recited, and easily retained them in his docile memory. He
was a zealous practiser of hunting in all its branches, and
hunted with great assiduity and success; for skill and good
fortune in this art, as in all others, are among the gifts of
God, as we also have often witnessed.</p>

<p>On a certain day, therefore, his mother<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> was showing him
and his brother a Saxon book of poetry, which she held in
her hand, and said, "Whichever of you shall the soonest
learn this volume shall have it for his own." Stimulated by
these words, or rather by the Divine inspiration, and allured
by the beautifully illuminated letter at the beginning of the
volume, he spoke before all his brothers, who, though his
seniors in age, were not so in grace, and answered, "Will
you really give that book to one of us, that is to say, to
him who can first understand and repeat it to you?" At this
his mother smiled with satisfaction, and confirmed what she
had before said. Upon which the boy took the book out of
her hand, and went to his master to read it, and in due time
brought it to his mother and recited it.</p>

<p>After this he learned the daily course, that is, the celebration
of the hours, and afterwards certain psalms, and
several prayers, contained in a certain book which he kept<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
day and night in his bosom, as we ourselves have seen,
and carried about with him to assist his prayers, amid all the
bustle and business of this present life. But, sad to say,
he could not gratify his most ardent wish to learn the liberal
arts, because, as he said, there were no good readers at that
time in all the kingdom of the West-Saxons.</p>

<p>This he confessed, with many lamentations and sighs, to have
been one of his greatest difficulties and impediments in this life,
namely, that when he was young and had the capacity for
learning, he could not find teachers; but, when he was
more advanced in life, he was harassed by so many diseases
unknown to all the physicians of this island, as well as by
internal and external anxieties of sovereignty, and by continual
invasions of the pagans, and had his teachers and
writers also so much disturbed, that there was no time for
reading. But yet among the impediments of this present
life, from infancy up to the present time, and, as I believe,
even until his death, he continued to feel the same insatiable
desire of knowledge, and still aspires after it.</p>

<p>In the year of our Lord's incarnation 867, which was the
nineteenth of the life of the aforesaid king Alfred, the army
of pagans before mentioned removed from the East-Angles
to the city of York, which is situated on the north bank of
the river Humber.</p>

<p>At that time a violent discord arose, by the instigation of
the devil, among the inhabitants of Northumberland; as
always is used to happen among a people who have incurred
the wrath of God. For the Northumbrians at that time, as
we have said, had expelled their lawful king Osbert, and
appointed a certain tyrant named &AElig;lla, not of royal birth,
over the affairs of the kingdom; but when the pagans approached,
by divine Providence, and the union of the nobles
for the common good, that discord was a little appeased,
and Osbert and &AElig;lla uniting their resources, and assembling
an army, marched to York. The pagans fled at their approach,
and attempted to defend themselves within the walls
of the city. The Christians, perceiving their flight and the
terror they were in, determined to destroy the walls of the
town, which they succeeded in doing; for that city was not
surrounded at that time with firm or strong walls, and when
the Christians had made a breach as they had purposed, and
many of them had entered into the town, the pagans, urged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
by despair and necessity, made a fierce sally upon them, slew
them, routed them, and cut them down on all sides, both
within and without the walls. In that battle fell almost all
the Northumbrian warriors, with both the kings and a multitude
of nobles; the remainder, who escaped, made peace
with the pagans.</p>

<p>In the same year, Ealstan, bishop of the church of Sherborne,
went the way of all flesh, after he had honourably
ruled his see four years, and he was buried at Sherborne.</p>

<p>In the year of our Lord's incarnation 868, which was the
twentieth of king Alfred's life, there was a severe famine.
Then the aforesaid revered king Alfred, but at that time occupying
a subordinate station, asked and obtained in marriage
a noble Mercian lady, daughter of Athelred, surnamed Mucil,<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
earl of the Gaini.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> The mother of this lady was named Edburga,
of the royal line of Mercia, whom we have often seen
with our own eyes a few years before her death. She was a
venerable lady, and after the decease of her husband, she
remained many years a widow, even till her own death.</p>

<p>In the same year, the above-named army of pagans, leaving
Northumberland, invaded Mercia and advanced to Nottingham,
which is called in the British tongue, "Tiggocobauc,"
but in Latin, the "House of Caves," and they wintered
there that same year. Immediately on their approach, Burhred,
king of Mercia, and all the nobles of that nation, sent
messengers to Ethelred, king of the West-Saxons, and his
brother Alfred, suppliantly entreating them to come and aid
them in fighting against the aforesaid army. Their request
was easily obtained; for the brothers, as soon as promised,
assembled an immense army from all parts of their dominions,
and entering Mercia, came to Nottingham, all eager
for battle, and when the pagans, defended by the castle, refused
to fight, and the Christians were unable to destroy the
wall, peace was made between the Mercians and pagans, and
the two brothers, Ethelred and Alfred, returned home with
their troops.</p>

<p>In the year of our Lord's incarnation 869, which was the
twenty-first of king Alfred's life, there was a great famine
and mortality of men, and a pestilence among the cattle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
And the aforesaid army of the pagans, galloping back to
Northumberland, went to York, and there passed the winter.</p>

<p>In the year of our Lord's incarnation 870, which was the
twenty-second of king Alfred's life, the above-named army
of pagans, passed through Mercia into East-Anglia, and
wintered at Thetford.</p>

<p>In the same year Edmund, king of the East-Angles, fought
most fiercely against them; but, lamentable to say, the
pagans triumphed, Edmund was slain in the battle, and the
enemy reduced all that country to subjection.</p>

<p>In the same year Ceolnoth, archbishop of Canterbury, went
the way of all flesh, and was buried peaceably in his own
city.</p>

<p>In the year of our Lord's incarnation 871, which was the
twenty-third of king Alfred's life, the pagan army, of hateful
memory, left the East-Angles, and entering the kingdom
of the West-Saxons, came to the royal city, called Reading,
situated on the south bank of the Thames, in the district
called Berkshire; and there, on the third day after their arrival,
their earls, with great part of the army, scoured the
country for plunder, while the others made a rampart between
the rivers Thames and Kennet on the right side of the same
royal city. They were encountered by Ethelwulf, earl of
Berkshire, with his men, at a place called Englefield;<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> both
sides fought bravely, and made long resistance. At length
one of the pagan earls was slain, and the greater part of the
army destroyed; upon which the rest saved themselves
by flight, and the Christians gained the victory.</p>

<p>Four days afterwards, Ethelred, king of the West-Saxons,
and his brother Alfred, united their forces and marched to
Reading, where, on their arrival, they cut to pieces the pagans
whom they found outside the fortifications. But the pagans,
nevertheless, sallied out from the gates, and a long and
fierce engagement ensued. At last, grief to say, the Christians
fled, the pagans obtained the victory, and the aforesaid earl
Ethelwulf was among the slain.</p>

<p>Roused by this calamity, the Christians, in shame and indignation,
within four days, assembled all their forces, and
again encountered the pagan army at a place called Ashdune,<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
which means the "Hill of the Ash." The pagans had divided<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
themselves into two bodies, and began to prepare defences,
for they had two kings and many earls, so they gave the
middle part of the army to the two kings, and the other
part to all their earls. Which the Christians perceiving,
divided their army also into two troops, and also began to
construct defences. But Alfred, as we have been told by
those who were present, and would not tell an untruth,
marched up promptly with his men to give them battle;
for king Ethelred remained a long time in his tent in prayer,
hearing the mass, and said that he would not leave it, till
the priest had done, or abandon the divine protection for
that of men. And he did so too, which afterwards availed
him much with the Almighty, as we shall declare more fully
in the sequel.</p>

<p>Now the Christians had determined that king Ethelred,
with his men, should attack the two pagan kings, but that
his brother Alfred, with his troops, should take the chance
of war against the two earls. Things being so arranged, the
king remained a long time in prayer, and the pagans came
up rapidly to fight. Then Alfred, though possessing a subordinate
authority, could no longer support the troops of
the enemy, unless he retreated or charged upon them without
waiting for his brother. At length he bravely led his
troops against the hostile army, as they had before arranged,
but without awaiting his brother's arrival; for he relied in
the divine counsels, and forming his men into a dense phalanx,
marched on at once to meet the foe.</p>

<p>But here I must inform those who are ignorant of the
fact, that the field of battle was not equally advantageous
to both parties. The pagans occupied the higher ground,
and the Christians came up from below. There was also a single
thorn-tree, of stunted growth, and we have with our own eyes
seen it. Around this tree the opposing armies came together
with loud shouts from all sides, the one party to
pursue their wicked course, the other to fight for their lives,
their dearest ties, and their country. And when both armies
had fought long and bravely, at last the pagans, by the divine
judgment, were no longer able to bear the attacks of
the Christians, and having lost great part of their army,
took to a disgraceful flight. One of their two kings, and
five earls were there slain, together with many thousand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
pagans, who fell on all sides, covering with their bodies the
whole plain of Ashdune.</p>

<p>There fell in that battle king Bagsac, earl Sidrac the
elder, and earl Sidrac the younger, earl Osbern, earl Frene,
and earl Harold; and the whole pagan army pursued its
flight, not only until night but until the next day, even until
they reached the stronghold from which they had sallied.
The Christians followed, slaying all they could reach, until it
became dark.</p>

<p>After fourteen days had elapsed, king Ethelred, with his
brother Alfred, again joined their forces and marched to
Basing to fight with the pagans. The enemy came together
from all quarters, and after a long contest gained the victory.
After this battle, another army came from beyond the sea,
and joined them.</p>

<p>The same year, after Easter, the aforesaid king Ethelred,
having bravely, honourably, and with good repute, governed
his kingdom five years, through much tribulation, went the
way of all flesh, and was buried in Wimborne Minster,
where he awaits the coming of the Lord, and the first resurrection
with the just.</p>

<p>The same year, the aforesaid Alfred, who had been up to
that time only of secondary rank, whilst his brothers were
alive, now, by God's permission, undertook the government
of the whole kingdom, amid the acclamations of all the
people; and if he had chosen, he might have done so before,
whilst his brother above-named was still alive; for in
wisdom and other qualities he surpassed all his brothers, and
moreover, was warlike and victorious in all his wars. And
when he had reigned one month, almost against his will, for
he did not think he could alone sustain the multitude and
ferocity of the pagans, though even during his brothers'
lives, he had borne the woes of many,&mdash;he fought a battle
with a few men, and on very unequal terms, against all the
army of the pagans, at a hill called Wilton, on the south
bank of the river Wily, from which river the whole of
that district is named, and after a long and fierce engagement,
the pagans, seeing the danger they were in, and no
longer able to bear the attack of their enemies, turned their
backs and fled. But, oh, shame to say, they deceived their
too audacious pursuers, and again rallying, gained the vic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>tory.
Let no one be surprised that the Christians had but
a small number of men, for the Saxons had been worn out
by eight battles in one year, against the pagans, of whom
they had slain one king, nine dukes, and innumerable troops
of soldiers, besides endless skirmishes, both by night and
by day, in which the oft-named Alfred, and all his chieftains,
with their men, and several of his ministers, were engaged
without rest or cessation against the pagans. How
many thousand pagans fell in these numberless skirmishes
God alone knows, over and above those who were slain in
the eight battles above-mentioned. In the same year the
Saxons made peace with the pagans, on condition that they
should take their departure, and they did so.</p>

<p>In the year of our Lord's incarnation 872, the twenty-fourth
of king Alfred's life, the above-named army of pagans
went to London, and there wintered. The Mercians made
peace with them.</p>

<p>In the year of our Lord's incarnation 873, the twenty-fifth
of king Alfred, the above-named army, leaving London,
went into the country of the Northumbrians, and there
wintered in the district of Lindsey; and the Mercians again
made treaty with them.</p>

<p>In the year of our Lord's incarnation 874, the twenty-sixth
since the birth of king Alfred, the army before so
often mentioned left Lindsey and marched to Mercia,
where they wintered at Repton. Also they compelled Burhred,
king of Mercia, against his will, to leave his kingdom
and go beyond the sea to Rome, in the twenty-second
year of his reign. He did not long live after his arrival,
but died there, and was honourably buried in the school of
the Saxons, in St. Mary's church, where he awaits the Lord's
coming and the first resurrection with the just. The pagans
also, after his expulsion, subjected the whole kingdom of the
Mercians to their dominion; but by a most miserable arrangement,
gave it into the custody of a certain foolish man,
named Ceolwulf, one of the king's ministers, on condition
that he should restore it to them, whenever they should wish
to have it again; and to guarantee this agreement, he gave
them hostages, and swore that he would not oppose their will,
but be obedient to them in every respect.</p>

<p>In the year of our Lord's incarnation 875, which was the
27th of king Alfred, the above-named army leaving Repton,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
divided into two bodies, one of which went with Halfdene into
Northumbria, and having wintered there near the Tyne, reduced
all Northumberland to subjection; they also ravaged
the Picts and the Strath-Clydensians.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> The other division, with
Gothrun, Oskytel, and Anwiund, three kings of the pagans,
went to a place called Grantabridge,<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> and there wintered.</p>

<p>In the same year, king Alfred fought a battle by sea
against six ships of the pagans, and took one of them; the
rest escaped by flight.</p>

<p>In the year of our Lord's incarnation 876, being the twenty-eighth
year of king Alfred's life, the aforesaid army of the
pagans, leaving Grantabridge by night, entered a castle called
Wareham, where there is a monasterium of holy virgins between
the two rivers Fraun<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> and Trent, in the district which
is called in British <i>Durngueis</i>, but in Saxon <i>Thorns&aelig;ta</i>, placed
in a most secure situation, except that it was exposed to danger
on the western side from the nature of the ground. With
this army Alfred made a solemn treaty, to the effect that
they should depart out of the kingdom, and for this they
made no hesitation to give as many hostages as he named; also
they swore an oath over the Christian relics,<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> which with king
Alfred were next in veneration after the Deity himself, that
they would depart speedily from the kingdom. But they again
practised their usual treachery, and caring nothing for the
hostages or their oaths, they broke the treaty, and sallying forth
by night, slew all the horsemen that the king had round him,
and turning off into Devon, to another place called in Saxon
<i>Exanceaster</i>,<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> but in British <i>Caer-wisc</i>, which means in Latin,
the city of Ex, situated on the eastern bank of the river Wisc,
they directed their course suddenly towards the south sea,
which divides Britain and Gaul, and there passed the winter.</p>

<p>In the same year, Halfdene, king of those parts, divided
out the whole country of Northumberland between himself
and his men, and settled there with his army. In the same
year, Rollo with his followers penetrated into Normandy.</p>

<p>This same Rollo, duke of the Normans, whilst wintering in
Old Britain, or England, at the head of his troops, enjoyed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
one night a vision revealing to him the future. See more of
this Rollo in the Annals.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>In the year 877, the pagans, on the approach of autumn,
partly settled in Exeter, and partly marched for plunder into
Mercia. The number of that disorderly crew increased every
day, so that, if thirty thousand of them were slain in one
battle, others took their places to double the number. Then
king Alfred commanded boats and galleys, i.e. long ships, to
be built throughout the kingdom, in order to offer battle by
sea to the enemy as they were coming. On board of these
he placed seamen, and appointed them to watch the seas.
Meanwhile he went himself to Exeter, where the pagans
were wintering, and having shut them up within the walls,
laid siege to the town. He also gave orders to his sailors to
prevent them from obtaining any supplies by sea; and his
sailors were encountered by a fleet of a hundred and twenty
ships full of armed soldiers, who were come to help their
countrymen. As soon as the king's men knew that they were
fitted with pagan soldiers, they leaped to their arms, and
bravely attacked those barbaric tribes: but the pagans, who
had now for almost a month been tossed and almost wrecked
among the waves of the sea, fought vainly against them;
their bands were discomfited in a moment, and all were sunk
and drowned in the sea, at a place called Suanewic.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>In the same year the army of pagans, leaving Wareham,
partly on horseback and partly by water, arrived at Suanewic,
where one hundred and twenty of their ships were lost;<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
and king Alfred pursued their land-army as far as Exeter;
there he made a covenant with them, and took hostages that
they would depart.</p>

<p>The same year, in the month of August, that army went
into Mercia, and gave part of that country to one Ceolwulf,
a weak-minded man, and one of the king's ministers; the
other part they divided among themselves.</p>

<p>In the year of our Lord's incarnation 878, which was the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
thirtieth of king Alfred's life, the army above-mentioned
left Exeter, and went to Chippenham, a royal villa, situated
in the west of Wiltshire, and on the eastern bank of
the river, which is called in British, the Avon. There they
wintered, and drove many of the inhabitants of that country
beyond the sea by the force of their arms, and by want of
the necessaries of life. They reduced almost entirely to subjection
all the people of that country.</p>

<p>At the same time the above-named Alfred, king of the
West-Saxons, with a few of his nobles, and certain soldiers
and vassals, used to lead an unquiet life among the woodlands<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
of the county of Somerset, in great tribulation; for he
had none of the necessaries of life, except what he could
forage openly or stealthily, by frequent sallies, from the pagans,
or even from the Christians who had submitted to the
rule of the pagans, and as we read in the Life of St. Neot,
at the house of one of his cowherds.</p>

<p>But it happened on a certain day, that the countrywoman,
wife of the cowherd, was preparing some loaves to bake,
and the king, sitting at the hearth, made ready his bow and
arrows and other warlike instruments. The unlucky woman
espying the cakes burning at the fire, ran up to remove
them, and rebuking the brave king, exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<p>
Ca'sn thee mind the ke-aks, man, an' doossen zee 'em burn?<br />
I'm boun thee's eat 'em vast enough, az zoon az 'tiz the turn.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a><br />
</p>

<p>The blundering woman little thought that it was king Alfred,
who had fought so many battles against the pagans, and
gained so many victories over them.</p>

<p>But the Almighty not only granted to the same glorious king
victories over his enemies, but also permitted him to be harassed
by them, to be sunk down by adversities, and depressed
by the low estate of his followers, to the end that he might
learn that there is one Lord of all things, to whom every
knee doth bow, and in whose hand are the hearts of kings;
who puts down the mighty from their seat and exalteth the
humble; who suffers his servants when they are elevated at
the summit of prosperity to be touched by the rod of ad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>versity,
that in their humility they may not despair of God's
mercy, and in their prosperity they may not boast of their
honours, but may also know, to whom they owe all the
things which they possess.</p>

<p>We may believe that the calamity was brought upon the
king aforesaid, because, in the beginning of his reign, when
he was a youth, and influenced by youthful feelings, he would
not listen to the petitions which his subjects made to him
for help in their necessities, or for relief from those who
oppressed them; but he repulsed them from him, and paid
no heed to their requests. This particular gave much annoyance
to the holy man St. Neot, who was his relation, and
often foretold to him, in the spirit of prophecy, that he would
suffer great adversity on this account; but Alfred neither attended
to the reproof of the man of God, nor listened to his
true prediction. Wherefore, seeing that a man's sins must
be corrected either in this world or the next, the true and
righteous Judge was willing that his sin should not go unpunished
in this world, to the end that he might spare
him in the world to come. From this cause, therefore, the
aforesaid Alfred often fell into such great misery, that sometimes
none of his subjects knew where he was or what had
become of him.</p>

<p>In the same year the brother<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> of Hingwar and Halfdene,
with twenty-three ships, after much slaughter of the Christians,
came from the country of Demetia,<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> where he had
wintered, and sailed to Devon, where, with twelve hundred
others, he met with a miserable death, being slain while committing
his misdeeds, by the king's servants, before the castle
of Cynuit (Kynwith<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>), into which many of the king's servants,
with their followers, had fled for safety. The pagans, seeing
that the castle was altogether unprepared and unfortified,
except that it had walls in our own fashion, determined not
to assault it, because it was impregnable and secure on all
sides, except on the eastern, as we ourselves have seen, but
they began to blockade it, thinking that those who were
inside would soon surrender either from famine or want of
water, for the castle had no spring near it. But the result
did not fall out as they expected; for the Christians, before
they began to suffer from want, inspired by Heaven, judging<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
it much better to gain victory or death, attacked the pagans
suddenly in the morning, and from the first cut them down
in great numbers, slaying also their king, so that few escaped
to their ships; and there they gained a very large booty, and
amongst other things the standard called Raven; for they
say that the three sisters of Hingwar and Hubba, daughters
of Lodobroch, wove that flag and got it ready in one day.
They say, moreover, that in every battle, wherever that flag
went before them, if they were to gain the victory a live
crow would appear flying on the middle of the flag; but if
they were doomed to be defeated it would hang down motionless,
and this was often proved to be so.</p>

<p>The same year, after Easter, king Alfred, with a few followers,
made for himself a stronghold in a place called
Athelney, and from thence sallied with his vassals and the
nobles of Somersetshire, to make frequent assaults upon the
pagans. Also, in the seventh week after Easter, he rode to
the stone of Egbert,<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> which is in the eastern part of the wood
which is called Selwood,<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> which means in Latin Silva Magna,
the Great Wood, but in British Coit-mawr. Here he was met
by all the neighbouring folk of Somersetshire, and Wiltshire,
and Hampshire, who had not, for fear of the pagans, fled
beyond the sea; and when they saw the king alive after such
great tribulation, they received him, as he deserved, with joy
and acclamations, and encamped there for one night. When
the following day dawned, the king struck his camp, and
went to Okely,<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> where he encamped for one night. The
next morning he removed to Edington, and there fought
bravely and perseveringly against all the army of the pagans,
whom, with the divine help, he defeated with great slaughter,
and pursued them flying to their fortification. Immediately
he slew all the men, and carried off all the booty that he
could find without the fortress, which he immediately laid
siege to with all his army; and when he had been there
fourteen days, the pagans, driven by famine, cold, fear, and
last of all by despair, asked for peace, on the condition that
they should give the king as many hostages as he pleased,
but should receive none of him in return, in which form they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
had never before made a treaty with any one. The king,
hearing that, took pity upon them, and received such hostages
as he chose; after which the pagans swore, moreover, that
they would immediately leave the kingdom; and their king,
Gothrun, promised to embrace Christianity, and receive
baptism at king Alfred's hands. All of which articles he
and his men fulfilled as they had promised. For after seven
weeks Gothrun, king of the pagans, with thirty men chosen
from the army, came to Alfred at a place called Aller, near
Athelney, and there king Alfred, receiving him as his son
by adoption, raised him up from the holy laver of baptism
on the eighth day, at a royal villa named Wedmore,<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> where
the holy chrism was poured upon him.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> After his baptism he
remained twelve nights with the king, who, with all his
nobles, gave him many fine houses.</p>

<p>In the year of our Lord's incarnation 879, which was the
thirty-first of king Alfred, the aforesaid army of pagans
leaving Chippenham, as they had promised, went to Cirencester,
which is called in British <i>Cair Cori</i>, and is situate in
the southern part of the Wiccii,<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> and there they remained
one year.</p>

<p>In the same year, a large army of pagans sailed from
foreign parts into the river Thames, and joined the army
which was already in the country. They wintered at Fulham
near the river Thames.</p>

<p>In the same year an eclipse of the sun took place, between
three o'clock and the evening, but nearer to three o'clock.</p>

<p>In the year of our Lord's incarnation 880, which was the
thirty-second of king Alfred, the above-named army of
pagans left Cirencester, and went among the East Angles,
where they divided out the country and began to settle.</p>

<p>The same year the army of pagans, which had wintered at
Fulham, left the island of Britain, and sailed over the sea
to the eastern part of France, where they remained a year
at a place called Ghent.</p>

<p>In the year of our Lord's incarnation 881, which was the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
thirty-third of king Alfred's life, the aforesaid army went higher
up into France; and the French fought against them; and
after the battle the pagans obtained horses and became an
army of cavalry.</p>

<p>In the year of our Lord's incarnation 882, the thirty-fourth
of king Alfred's life, the above-named army steered their
ships up into France by a river called the Mese [Meuse] and
there wintered one year.</p>

<p>In the same year Alfred, king of the Anglo-Saxons, fought
a battle by sea against the pagan fleet, of which he captured
two ships, having slain all who were on board; and the
two commanders of two other ships, with all their crews,
distressed by the battle and the wounds which they had received,
laid down their arms and submitted to the king.</p>

<p>In the year of our Lord's incarnation 883, which was the
thirty-fifth of king Alfred's life, the aforesaid army went
up the river called Scald [Scheldt] to a convent of nuns called
Cundoht [Cond&eacute;] and there remained a year.</p>

<p>In the year of our Lord's incarnation 884, which was the
thirty-sixth of king Alfred's life, the aforesaid army divided
into two parts; one body of them went into East France,
and the other coming to Britain entered Kent, where they
besieged a city called in Saxon Rochester, and situated on
the eastern bank of the river Medway. Before the gate of
the town the pagans suddenly erected a strong fortress, but
yet they were unable to take the city, because the citizens
defended themselves bravely, until king Alfred came up to
help them with a large army. Then the pagans abandoned
their fortress, and all their horses which they had brought
with them out of France, and leaving behind them in the
fortress the greater part of their prisoners, on the arrival of
the king, fled immediately to their ships, and the Saxons immediately
seized on the prisoners and horses left by the
pagans; and so the pagans, compelled by stern necessity,
returned the same summer to France.</p>

<p>In the same year Alfred, king of the Anglo-Saxons, led
his fleet, full of fighting men, out of Kent to the country of
the East Angles, for the sake of plunder;<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> and, when they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
had arrived at the mouth of the river Stour,<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> immediately
thirteen ships of the pagans met them, prepared for battle;
a fierce fight ensued, and all the pagans, after a brave resistance,
were slain; all the ships, with all their money, were
taken. After this, while the royal fleet were reposing, the
pagans, who lived in the eastern part of England, assembled
their ships, met the same royal fleet at sea in the mouth of
the same river, and, after a naval battle, the pagans gained
the victory.</p>

<p>In the same year, also, Carloman, king of the Western
Franks, whilst hunting a wild boar, was miserably killed by
a large animal of that species, which inflicted a dreadful
wound on him with its tusk. His brother Louis [III], who
had also been king of the Franks, died the year before. These
two brothers were sons of Louis, king of the Franks, who
had died in the year above-mentioned, in which the eclipse
of the sun took place; and it was he whose daughter Judith
was given by her father's wish in marriage to Ethelwulf,
king of the West Saxons.</p>

<p>In the same year also a great army of the pagans came
from Germany into the country of the ancient Saxons, which
is called in Saxon Ealdseaxum.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> To oppose them the said
Saxons and Frisons joined their forces, and fought bravely
twice in that same year. In both those battles the Christians,
with the merciful aid of the Lord, obtained the victory.</p>

<p>In the same year also, Charles, king of the Almains, received,
with universal consent, all the territories which lie
between the Tyrrhenian sea and that gulf which runs between
the old Saxons and the Gauls, except the kingdom of Armorica,
i.e. Lesser Britain. This Charles was the son of
king Louis, who was brother of Charles, king of the Franks,
father of the aforesaid queen Judith; these two brothers
were sons of Louis, but Louis was the son of the great, the
ancient, and wise Charlemagne, who was the son of Pepin.</p>

<p>In the same year pope Martin, of blessed memory, went
the way of all flesh; it was he who, in regard for Alfred,
king of the Anglo-Saxons, and at his request, freed the
school of the Anglo-Saxons resident at Rome from all tribute
and tax. He also sent many gifts on that occasion, among<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
which was no small portion of the holy and venerable cross
on which our Lord Jesus Christ was suspended, for the
general salvation of mankind.</p>

<p>In the same year also the army of pagans, which dwelt
among the East Angles, disgracefully broke the peace which
they had concluded with king Alfred.</p>

<p>Wherefore, to return to that from which I digressed, that
I may not be compelled by my long navigation to abandon
the port of rest which I was making for, I propose, as far as
my knowledge will enable me, to speak of the life and character
and just conduct of my lord Alfred, king of the
Anglo-Saxons, after he married the above-named respected
lady of Mercian race, his wife; and, with God's blessing, I
will despatch it succinctly and briefly, as I promised, that I
may not offend the delicate minds of my readers by prolixity
in relating each new event.</p>

<p>His nuptials were honourably celebrated in Mercia, among
innumerable multitudes of people of both sexes; and after
continual feasts, both by night and by day, he was immediately
seized, in presence of all the people, by sudden and
overwhelming pain, as yet unknown to all the physicians;
for it was unknown to all who were then present, and even
to those who daily see him up to the present time,&mdash;which,
sad to say! is the worst of all, that he should have protracted
it so long from the twentieth to the fortieth year of his life,
and even more than that through the space of so many years,&mdash;from
what cause so great a malady arose. For many thought
that this was occasioned by the favour and fascination of
the people who surrounded him; others, by some spite of the
devil, who is ever jealous of the good; others, from an unusual
kind of fever. He had this sort of severe disease from
his childhood; but once, divine Providence so ordered it,
that when he was on a visit to Cornwall for the sake of
hunting, and had turned out of the road to pray in a certain
chapel, in which rests the body of Saint Guerir,<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> and now
also St. Neot<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> rests there,&mdash;for king Alfred was always from
his infancy a frequent visitor of holy places for the sake of
prayer and almsgiving,&mdash;he prostrated himself for private
devotion, and, after some time spent therein, he entreated of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
God's mercy, that in his boundless clemency he would exchange
the torments of the malady which then afflicted him
for some other lighter disease; but with this condition, that
such disease should not show itself outwardly in his body,
lest he should be an object of contempt, and less able to
benefit mankind; for he had great dread of leprosy or blindness,
or any such complaint, as makes men useless or contemptible
when it afflicts them. When he had finished his
prayers, he proceeded on his journey, and not long after he
felt within him that by the hand of the Almighty he was
healed, according to his request, of his disorder, and that it
was entirely eradicated, although he had first had even this
complaint in the flower of his youth, by his devout and pious
prayers and supplications to Almighty God. For if I may
be allowed to speak briefly, but in a somewhat preposterous
order, of his zealous piety to God, in the flower of his youth,
before he entered the marriage state, he wished to strengthen
his mind in the observance of God's commandments, for he
perceived that he could with difficulty abstain from gratifying
his carnal desires; and, because he feared the anger of God,
if he should do anything contrary to his will, he used often
to rise in the morning at the cock-crow, and go to pray in the
churches and at the relics of the saints. There he prostrated
himself on the ground, and prayed that God in his mercy
would strengthen his mind still more in his service by some
infirmity such as he might bear, but not such as would
render him imbecile and contemptible in his worldly duties;
and when he had often prayed with much devotion to this
effect, after an interval of some time, Providence vouchsafed
to afflict him with the above-named disease, which he bore
long and painfully for many years, and even despaired of
life, until he entirely got rid of it by his prayers; but, sad
to say! it was replaced, as we have said, at his marriage by
another which incessantly tormented him, night and day,
from the twentieth to the forty-fourth year of his life. But
if ever, by God's mercy, he was relieved from this infirmity
for a single day or night, yet the fear and dread of that
dreadful malady never left him, but rendered him almost
useless, as he thought, for every duty, whether human or
divine.</p>

<p>The sons and daughters, which he had by his wife above
mentioned were Ethelfled the eldest, after whom came Ed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>ward,
then Ethelgiva, then Ethelswitha, and Ethelwerd,
besides those who died in their infancy, one of whom was
Edmund. Ethelfled, when she arrived at a marriageable age,
was united to Ethered, earl of Mercia; Ethelgiva also was
dedicated to God, and submitted to the rules of a monastic
life. Ethelwerd the youngest, by the divine counsels and the
admirable prudence of the king, was consigned to the schools
of learning, where, with the children of almost all the nobility
of the country, and many also who were not noble, he
prospered under the diligent care of his teachers. Books in
both languages, namely, Latin and Saxon, were both read in
the school. They also learned to write; so that before they
were of an age to practice manly arts, namely, hunting and
such pursuits as befit noblemen, they became studious and
clever in the liberal arts. Edward and Ethelswitha were bred
up in the king's court and received great attention from their
attendants and nurses; nay, they continue to this day, with
the love of all about them, and showing affability, and even
gentleness towards all, both natives and foreigners, and in
complete subjection to their father; nor, among their other
studies which appertain to this life and are fit for noble
youths, are they suffered to pass their time idly and unprofitably
without learning the liberal arts; for they have carefully
learned the Psalms and Saxon books, especially the Saxon
poems, and are continually in the habit of making use of
books.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the king, during the frequent wars and
other trammels of this present life, the invasions of the
pagans, and his own daily infirmities of body, continued to
carry on the government, and to exercise hunting in all its
branches; to teach his workers in gold and artificers of all
kinds, his falconers, hawkers and dog-keepers; to build houses,
majestic and good, beyond all the precedents of his ancestors,
by his new mechanical inventions; to recite the Saxon
books, and especially to learn by heart the Saxon poems, and
to make others learn them; and he alone never desisted from
studying, most diligently, to the best of his ability; he attended
the mass and other daily services of religion; he was frequent
in psalm-singing and prayer, at the hours both of
the day and the night. He also went to the churches, as we
have already said, in the night-time to pray, secretly, and
unknown to his courtiers; he bestowed alms and largesses on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
both natives and foreigners of all countries; he was affable
and pleasant to all, and curiously eager to investigate things
unknown. Many Franks, Frisons, Gauls, pagans, Britons,
Scots, and Armoricans, noble and ignoble, submitted voluntarily
to his dominion; and all of them, according to
their nation and deserving, were ruled, loved, honoured, and
enriched with money and power. Moreover, the king was in
the habit of hearing the divine scriptures read by his own countrymen,
or, if by any chance it so happened, in company with
foreigners, and he attended to it with sedulity and solicitude.
His bishops, too, and all ecclesiastics, his earls and nobles,
ministers and friends, were loved by him with wonderful affection,
and their sons, who were bred up in the royal household,
were no less dear to him than his own; he had them
instructed in all kinds of good morals, and among other
things, never ceased to teach them letters night and day; but
as if he had no consolation in all these things, and suffered
no other annoyance either from within or without, yet he
was harassed by daily and nightly affliction, that he complained
to God, and to all who were admitted to his familiar
love, that Almighty God had made him ignorant of divine
wisdom, and of the liberal arts; in this emulating the pious,
the wise, and wealthy Solomon, king of the Hebrews, who
at first, despising all present glory and riches, asked wisdom
of God, and found both, namely, wisdom and worldly glory;
as it is written, "Seek first the kingdom of God and his
righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you."
But God, who is always the inspector of the thoughts of the
mind within, and the instigator of all good intentions, and a
most plentiful aider, that good desires may be formed,&mdash;for
he would not instigate a man to good intentions, unless he
also amply supplied that which the man justly and properly
wishes to have,&mdash;instigated the king's mind within; as it is
written, "I will hearken what the Lord God will say concerning
me." He would avail himself of every opportunity to
procure coadjutors in his good designs, to aid him in his
strivings after wisdom, that he might attain to what he aimed
at; and, like a prudent bird, which rising in summer with
the early morning from her beloved nest, steers her rapid
flight through the uncertain tracks of ether, and descends
on the manifold and varied flowers of grasses, herbs, and
shrubs, essaying that which pleases most, that she may bear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
it to her home, so did he direct his eyes afar, and seek
without, that which he had not within, namely, in his own
kingdom.</p>

<p>But God at that time, as some consolation to the king's
benevolence, yielding to his complaint, sent certain lights
to illuminate him, namely, Werefrith, bishop of the church
of Worcester, a man well versed in divine scripture, who,
by the king's command, first turned the books of the
Dialogues of pope Gregory and Peter, his disciple, from
Latin into Saxon, and sometimes putting sense for sense,
interpreted them with clearness and elegance. After him
was Plegmund, a Mercian by birth, archbishop of the church
of Canterbury, a venerable man, and endowed with wisdom;
Ethelstan also, and Werewulf, his priests and chaplains, Mercians
by birth, and erudite. These four had been invited out
of Mercia by king Alfred, who exalted them with many
honours and powers in the kingdom of the West-Saxons,
besides the privileges which archbishop Plegmund and bishop
Werefrith enjoyed in Mercia. By their teaching and wisdom
the king's desires increased unceasingly, and were gratified.
Night and day, whenever he had leisure, he commanded such
men as these to read books to him; for he never suffered
himself to be without one of them, wherefore he possessed a
knowledge of every book, though of himself he could not
yet understand anything of books, for he had not yet learned
to read any thing.</p>

<p>But the king's commendable avarice could not be gratified
even in this; wherefore he sent messengers beyond the sea
to Gaul, to procure teachers, and he invited from thence
Grimbald,<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> priest and monk, a venerable man, and good
singer, adorned with every kind of ecclesiastical discipline
and good morals, and most learned in holy scripture. He
also obtained from thence John,<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> also priest and monk, a man
of most energetic talents, and learned in all kinds of literary
science, and skilled in many other arts. By the teaching of
these men the king's mind was much enlarged, and he enriched
and honoured them with much influence.</p>

<p>In these times, I also came into Saxony out of the furthest
coasts of Western Britain; and when I had proposed to go
to him through many intervening provinces, I arrived in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
country of the Saxons, who live on the right hand, which in
Saxon is called Sussex, under the guidance of some of that
nation; and there I first saw him in the royal vill, which is
called Dene.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> He received me with kindness, and among
other familiar conversation, he asked me eagerly to devote
myself to his service and become his friend, to leave every
thing which I possessed on the left, or western bank of the
Severn, and he promised he would give more than an equivalent
for it in his own dominions. I replied that I could
not incautiously and rashly promise such things; for it
seemed to me unjust, that I should leave those sacred
places in which I had been bred, educated, and crowned,<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
and at last ordained, for the sake of any earthly honour and
power, unless by compulsion. Upon this, he said, "If you
cannot accede to this, at least, let me have your service in
part: spend six months of the year with me here, and the
other six in Britain." To this, I replied, "I could not even
promise that easily or hastily without the advice of my
friends." At length, however, when I perceived that he was
anxious for my services, though I knew not why, I promised
him that, if my life was spared, I would return to him after
six months, with such a reply as should be agreeable to him
as well as advantageous to me and mine. With this answer
he was satisfied, and when I had given him a pledge to return
at the appointed time, on the fourth day we left him and
returned on horseback towards our own country.</p>

<p>After our departure, a violent fever seized me in the city
of Winchester, where I lay for twelve months and one week,
night and day, without hope of recovery. At the appointed
time, therefore, I could not fulfil my promise of visiting him,
and he sent messengers to hasten my journey, and to inquire
the cause of my delay. As I was unable to ride to him, I
sent a second messenger to tell him the cause of my delay,
and assure him that, if I recovered from my infirmity, I
would fulfil what I had promised. My complaint left me,
and by the advice and consent of all my friends, for the
benefit of that holy place, and of all who dwelt therein,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
I did as I had promised to the king, and devoted myself
to his service, on the condition that I should remain with
him six months in every year, either continuously, if I
could spend six months with him at once, or alternately,
three months in Britain and three in Saxony.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> For my
friends hoped that they should sustain less tribulation and
harm from king Hemeid.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> who often plundered that monastery
and the parish of St. Deguus,<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> and sometimes expelled the
prelates, as they expelled archbishop Novis,<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> my relation,
and myself; if in any manner I could secure the notice and
friendship of the king.</p>

<p>At that time, and long before, all the countries on the right
hand side of Britain belonged to king Alfred and still belong
to him. For instance, king Hemeid, with all the
inhabitants of the region of Demetia, compelled by the violence
of the six sons of Rotri, had submitted to the dominion
of the king. Howel also, son of Ris, king of Gleguising,
and Brocmail and Fernmail, sons of Mouric, kings of Gwent,
compelled by the violence and tyranny of earl Ethered and
of the Mercians, of their own accord sought king Alfred,
that they might enjoy his government and protection from
him against their enemies. Helised, also, son of Tendyr,
king of Brecon, compelled by the force of the same sons of
Rotri, of his own accord sought the government of the aforesaid
king; and Anarawd, son of Rotri, with his brother, at
length abandoning the friendship of the Northumbrians,
from which he received no good but harm, came into king
Alfred's presence and eagerly sought his friendship. The
king received him honourably, received him as his son by
confirmation from the bishop's hand, and presented him with
many gifts. Thus he became subject to the king with all
his people, on the same condition, that he should be obedient
to the king's will in all respects, in the same way as Ethered
with the Mercians.</p>

<p>Nor was it in vain that all these princes gained the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
friendship of the king. For those who desired to augment
their worldly power, obtained power; those who desired
money, gained money; and in like way, those who desired
his friendship, or both money and friendship, succeeded in
getting what they wanted. But all of them gained his love
and guardianship and defence from every quarter, even as the
king with his men could protect himself.</p>

<p>When therefore I had come into his presence at the royal
vill, called Leonaford, I was honourably received by him, and
remained that time with him at his court eight months; during
which I read to him whatever books he liked, and such as he
had at hand; for this is his most usual custom, both night
and day, amid his many other occupations of mind and body,
either himself to read books, or to listen whilst others read
them. And when I frequently asked his leave to depart,
and could in no way obtain it, at length when I had made
up my mind by all means to demand it, he called me to
him at twilight, on Christmas eve, and gave me two letters,
in which was a long list of all the things which were in
two monasteries, called in Saxon, Ambresbury<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> and Banwell;<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>
and on that same day he delivered to me those two monasteries
with all the things that were in them, and a silken
pall of great value, and a load for a strong man, of incense,
adding these words, that he did not give me these trifling
presents, because he was unwilling hereafter to give me
greater; for in the course of time he unexpectedly gave me
Exeter, with all the diocese which belonged to him in Saxony<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>
and in Cornwall, besides gifts every day, without number, in
every kind of worldly wealth, which it would be too long to
enumerate here, lest they should make my reader tired.
But let no one suppose that I have mentioned these presents
in this place for the sake of glory or flattery, or to
obtain greater honour. I call God to witness, that I have
not done so; but that I might certify to those who are ignorant,
how profuse he is in giving. He then at once gave
me permission to ride to those two rich monasteries and
afterwards to return to my own country.</p>

<p>In the year of our Lord's incarnation, 886, which was the
thirty-eighth since the birth of Alfred, the army so often
before-mentioned again fled the country, and went into the
country of the Western Franks, directing their ships to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
river called the Seine, and sailed up it as far as the city of
Paris, and there they wintered and measured out their camp.
They besieged that city a whole year, as far as the bridge,
that they might prevent the inhabitants from making use of
it; for the city is situated on a small island in the middle
of the river; but by the merciful favour of God, and the
brave defence of citizens, the army could not force their way
inside the walls.</p>

<p>In the same year, Alfred, king of the Anglo-Saxons, after
the burning of cities and the slaying of the people, honourably
rebuilt the city of London, and made it again habitable.
He gave it into the custody of his son-in-law, Ethered, earl
of Mercia, to which king all the Angles and Saxons, who
before had been dispersed everywhere, or were in captivity
with the pagans, voluntarily turned and submitted themselves
to his dominion.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>
[In the same year there arose a foul and deadly discord
at Oxford, between Grimbald, with those learned men whom
he had brought with him, and the old scholars whom he had
found there, who, on his arrival, refused altogether to embrace
the laws, modes, and forms of pr&aelig;lection instituted by
the same Grimbald. During three years there had been no
great dissension between them, but there was a secret enmity,
which afterwards broke out with great atrocity, clearer than
the light itself. To appease this quarrel, that invincible king
Alfred, having been informed of the strife by a messenger
from Grimbald, went to Oxford to put an end to the controversy,
and endured much trouble in hearing the arguments
and complaints which were brought forwards on both sides.
The substance of the dispute was this: the old scholars contended,
that literature had flourished at Oxford before the
coming of Grimbald, although the number of scholars was
smaller than in ancient time, because several had been driven
away by the cruelty and tyranny of the pagans. They also
proved and showed, by the undoubted testimony of ancient
annals, that the orders and institutions of that place had
been sanctioned by certain pious and learned men, as for
instance by Saint Gildas, Melkinus, Nennius, Kentigern, and
others, who had all grown old there in literature, and happily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
administered everything there in peace and concord; and
also, that Saint Germanus had come to Oxford, and stopped
there half a year, at the time when he went through Britain
to preach against the Pelagian heresy; he wonderfully approved
of the customs and institutions above-mentioned.
The king, with unheard-of humility, listened to both sides carefully,
and exhorted them again and again with pious and
wholesome admonitions to cherish mutual love and concord.
He therefore left them with this decision, that each party
should follow their own counsel, and preserve their own
institutions. Grimbald, displeased at this, immediately departed
to the monastery at Winchester,<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> which had been
recently founded by king Alfred, and ordered a tomb to be
carried to Winchester, in which he proposed, after this life,
that his bones should be laid in the vault which had been
made under the chancel of St. Peter's church in Oxford;
which church the same Grimbald had built from its foundations,
of stone polished with great care.]</p>

<p>In the year of our Lord's incarnation 887, which was the
thirty-ninth of king Alfred's life, the above-mentioned army
of the pagans, leaving the city of Paris uninjured, because
they could not succeed against it, sailed up the river Seine
under the bridge, until they reached the mouth of the river
Materne [Marne]; where they left the Seine, and, following
for a long time the course of the Marne, at length, but not
without much labour, they arrived at a place called Chezy, a
royal vill, where they wintered one year. In the following
year they entered the mouth of the river Ionna [Yonne], not
without doing much damage to the country, and there remained
one year.</p>

<p>In the same year Charles, king of the Franks, went the
way of all flesh; but Arnulf, his brother's son, six weeks
before he died, had expelled him from his kingdom. After
his death five kings were appointed, and the kingdom was
split into five parts; but the principal rank in the kingdom
justly and deservedly devolved on Arnulf, save only that he
committed an unworthy offence against his uncle. The other
four kings promised fidelity and obedience to Arnulf, as was
proper; for none of these four kings was hereditary on his
father's side in his share of the kingdom, as was Arnulf;
therefore, though the five kings were appointed immediately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
on the death of Charles, yet the empire remained in the
hands of Arnulf.</p>

<p>Such, then, was the division of the kingdom; Arnulf received
the countries on the east of the river Rhine; Rodulf
the inner parts of the kingdom; Oda the western part;
Beorngar and Guido, Lombardy, and those countries which
are in that part of the mountains; but they did not keep
these large dominions in peace, for they twice fought a
pitched battle, and often mutually ravaged their kingdoms,
and drove each other out of their dominions.</p>

<p>In the same year in which that [pagan] army left Paris
and went to Chezy, Ethelhelm, earl of Wiltshire, carried to
Rome the alms of king Alfred and of the Saxons.</p>

<p>In the same year also Alfred, king of the Anglo-Saxons,
so often before mentioned, by divine inspiration, began, on
one and the same day, to read and to interpret; but that I
may explain this more fully to those who are ignorant, I will
relate the cause of this long delay in beginning.</p>

<p>On a certain day we were both of us sitting in the king's
chamber, talking on all kinds of subjects, as usual, and it
happened that I read to him a quotation out of a certain
book. He heard it attentively with both his ears, and addressed
me with a thoughtful mind, showing me at the same
moment a book which he carried in his bosom, wherein the
daily courses and psalms, and prayers which he had read in
his youth, were written, and he commanded me to write the
same quotation in that book. Hearing this, and perceiving
his ingenuous benevolence, and devout desire of studying
the words of divine wisdom, I gave, though in secret, boundless
thanks to Almighty God, who had implanted such a love
of wisdom in the king's heart. But I could not find any
empty space in that book wherein to write the quotation, for
it was already full of various matters; wherefore I made a
little delay, principally that I might stir up the bright intellect
of the king to a higher acquaintance with the divine testimonies.
Upon his urging me to make haste and write it
quickly, I said to him, "Are you willing that I should write
that quotation on some leaf apart? For it is not certain
whether we shall not find one or more other such extracts
which will please you; and if that should so happen, we
shall be glad that we have kept them apart." "Your plan
is good," said he, and I gladly made haste to get ready a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
sheet, in the beginning of which I wrote what he bade me;
and on that same day, I wrote therein, as I had anticipated,
no less than three other quotations which pleased him; and
from that time we daily talked together, and found out other
quotations which pleased him, so that the sheet became full,
and deservedly so; according as it is written, "The just
man builds upon a moderate foundation, and by degrees
passes to greater things." Thus, like a most productive bee,
he flew here and there, asking questions, as he went, until
he had eagerly and unceasingly collected many various
flowers of divine Scriptures, with which he thickly stored the
cells of his mind.</p>

<p>Now when that first quotation was copied, he was eager at
once to read, and to interpret in Saxon, and then to teach
others; even as we read of that happy robber, who recognized
his Lord, aye, the Lord of all men, as he was hanging
on the blessed cross, and, saluting him with his bodily eyes
only, because elsewhere he was all pierced with nails, cried,
"Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom!"
for it was only at the end of his life that he began to learn
the rudiments of the Christian faith. But the king, inspired
by God, began to study the rudiments of divine Scripture on
the sacred solemnity of St. Martin [Nov. 11], and he continued
to learn the flowers collected by certain masters, and
to reduce them into the form of one book, as he was then
able, although mixed one with another, until it became almost
as large as a psalter. This book he called his <span class="smcap">Enchiridion</span>
or <span class="smcap">Manual</span>, because he carefully kept it at hand day and
night, and found, as he told me, no small consolation therein.</p>

<p>But as has already been written by a certain wise man,</p>

<p style="margin-left:6em;">
"Of watchful minds are they whose pious care<br />
It is to govern well,"<br />
</p>

<p>so must I be watchful, in that I just now drew a kind of comparison
or similarity, though in dissimilar manner, between that
happy robber and the king; for the cross is hateful to every
one, wherever there is suffering. But what can he do, if he
cannot save himself or escape thence? or by what art can he
remain there and improve his cause? He must, therefore,
whether he will or no, endure with pain and sorrow that
which he is suffering.</p>

<p>Now the king was pierced with many nails of tribulation,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
though placed in the royal seat; for from the twentieth year
of his age to the present year, which is his fortieth,<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> he has
been constantly afflicted with most severe attacks of an unknown
complaint, so that he has not a moment's ease either
from suffering the pain which it causes, or from the gloom
which is thrown over him by the apprehension of its coming.
Moreover, the constant invasions of foreign nations, by which
he was continually harassed by land and sea, without any
interval of quiet, were a just cause of disquiet. What
shall I say of his repeated expeditions against the pagans,
his wars, and incessant occupations of government? Of the
daily embassies sent to him by foreign nations, from the
Tyrrhenian sea to the farthest end of Ireland?<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> For we
have seen and read letters, accompanied with presents, which
were sent to him by Abel the patriarch of Jerusalem. What
shall I say of the cities and towns which he restored, and
of others which he built, where none had been before? of
the royal halls and chambers, wonderfully erected by his
command, with stone and wood? of the royal vills constructed
of stone, removed from their old site, and handsomely rebuilt
by the king's command in more fitting places? Besides the
disease above-mentioned, he was disturbed by the quarrels of
his friends, who would voluntarily endure little or no toil,
though it was for the common necessity of the kingdom;
but he alone, sustained by the divine aid, like a skilful
pilot, strove to steer his ship, laden with much wealth, into
the safe and much desired harbour of his country, though
almost all his crew were tired, and suffered them not to faint
or hesitate, though sailing amid the manifold waves and
eddies of this present life.</p>

<p>For all his bishops, earls, nobles, favourite ministers, and
prefects, who, next to God and the king, had the whole government
of the kingdom, as is fitting, continually received
from him instruction, respect, exhortation, and command;
nay, at last, when they were disobedient, and his long patience
was exhausted, he would reprove them severely, and censure
at pleasure their vulgar folly and obstinacy; and in this way
he directed their attention to the common interests of the
kingdom. But, owing to the sluggishness of the people,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
these admonitions of the king were either not fulfilled, or
were begun late at the moment of necessity, and so ended
less to the advantage of those who put them in execution;
for I will say nothing of the castles which he ordered to be
built, but which, being begun late, were never finished, because
the hostile troops broke in upon them by land and sea, and,
as often happened, the thwarters of the royal ordinances repented
when it was too late, and blushed at their non-performance
of his commands. I speak of repentance when it is too
late, on the testimony of Scripture, whereby numberless
persons have had cause for too much sorrow when many insidious
evils have been wrought. But though by these
means, sad to say, they may be bitterly afflicted and roused
to sorrow by the loss of fathers, wives, children, ministers,
servant-men, servant-maids, and furniture and household
stuff, what is the use of hateful repentance when their kinsmen
are dead, and they cannot aid them, or redeem those
who are captive from captivity? for they are not able even to
assist those who have escaped, as they have not wherewith
to sustain even their own lives. They repented, therefore,
when it was too late, and grieved at their incautious neglect
of the king's commands, and they praised the royal wisdom
with one voice, and tried with all their power to fulfil what
they had before refused, namely, concerning the erection of
castles, and other things generally useful to the whole
kingdom.</p>

<p>Of his fixed purpose of holy meditation, which, in the
midst of prosperity and adversity he never neglected, I cannot
with advantage now omit to speak. For, whereas he often
thought of the necessities of his soul, among the other good
deeds to which his thoughts were night and day turned, he
ordered that two monasteries should be built, one for monks
at Athelney, which is a place surrounded by impassable
marshes and rivers, where no one can enter but by boats, or
by a bridge laboriously constructed between two other
heights; at the western end of which bridge was erected a
strong tower, of beautiful work, by command of the aforesaid
king; and in this monastery he collected monks of all kinds,
from every quarter, and placed them therein.</p>

<p>For at first, because he had no one of his own nation,
noble and free by birth, who was willing to enter the monastic
life, except children, who could neither choose good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
nor avoid evil in consequence of their tender years, because
for many previous years the love of a monastic life had utterly
decayed from that nation as well as from many other nations,
though many monasteries still remain in that country; yet, as
no one directed the rule of that kind of life in a regular way,
for what reason I cannot say, either from the invasions of
foreigners which took place so frequently both by sea and
land, or because that people abounded in riches of every
kind, and so looked with contempt on the monastic life. It
was for this reason that king Alfred sought to gather monks
of different kinds to place in the same monastery.</p>

<p>First he placed there as abbat, John<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> the priest and monk,
an old Saxon by birth, then certain priests and deacons from
beyond the sea; of whom, finding that he had not as large a
number as he wished, he procured as many as possible of the
same Gallic race, some of whom, being children, he ordered
to be taught in the same monastery, and at a later period to
be admitted to the monastic habit. I have myself seen a
young lad of pagan birth who was educated in that monastery,
and by no means the hindmost of them all.</p>

<p>There was also a deed done once in that monastery, which
I would utterly consign to oblivion, although it is an unworthy
deed; for throughout the whole of Scripture the base
deeds of the wicked are interspersed among the blessed deeds
of the just, as tares and darnel are sown among the wheat:
good deeds are recorded that they may be praised and imitated,
and that their imitators may be held in all honour;
wicked deeds are there related, that they may be censured
and avoided, and their imitators be reproved with all odium,
contempt, and vengeance.</p>

<p>For once upon a time, a certain priest and a deacon, Gauls
by birth, and two of the aforesaid monks, by the instigation
of the devil, and excited by some secret jealousy,
became so embittered in secret against their abbat, the above
mentioned John, that, like Jews, they circumvented and betrayed
their master. For whereas he had two servants, whom
he had hired out of Gaul, they taught these such wicked
practices, that in the night, when all men were enjoying the
sweet tranquillity of sleep, they should make their way into
the church armed, and shutting it behind them as usual, hide
themselves therein, and wait for the moment when the abbat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
should enter the church alone. At length, when he should
come alone to pray, and, bending his knees, bow before the
holy altar, the men should rush on him with hostility, and
try to slay him on the spot. They then should drag his
lifeless body out of the church, and throw it down before the
house of a certain harlot, as if he had been slain whilst on a
visit to her. This was their machination, adding crime to
crime, as it is said, "The last error shall be worse than the
first."</p>

<p>But the divine mercy, which always delights to aid the
innocent, frustrated in great part the wicked design of the
wicked men, so that it should not turn out in every respect
as they had proposed.</p>

<p>When, therefore, the whole of the evil counsel had been
explained by those wicked teachers to their wicked agents,
and the night which had been fixed on as most fit was come,
the two armed ruffians were placed, with a promise of impunity,
to await in the church for the arrival of the abbat.
In the middle of the night John, as usual, entered the
church to pray, without any one's knowing of it, and knelt
before the altar. The two ruffians rushed upon him with
drawn swords, and dealt him some severe wounds. But he,
being a man of a brave mind, and, as we have heard say, not
unacquainted with the art of self-defence, if he had not been
a follower of a better calling, no sooner heard the sound of
the robbers, before he saw them, than he rose up against
them before he was wounded, and, shouting as loud as he
could, struggled against them, crying out that they were
devils and not men; for he himself knew no better, as he
thought that no men would dare to attempt such a deed.
He was, however, wounded before any of his people could
come to his help. His attendants, roused by the noise, were
frightened when they heard the word devils, and both those
two who, like Jews, sought to betray their master, and the
others who knew nothing of the matter, rushed together to
the doors of the church; but before they got there those
ruffians escaped, leaving the abbat half dead. The monks
raised the old man, in a fainting condition, and carried him
home with tears and lamentations; nor did those two deceitful
monks shed tears less than the innocent. But God's
mercy did not allow so bold a deed to pass unpunished; the
ruffians who perpetrated it, and all who urged them to it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
were taken and put in prison, where, by various tortures,
they came to a disgraceful end. Let us now return to our
narrative.</p>

<p>Another monastery, also, was built by the same king as a
residence for nuns, near the eastern gate of Shaftesbury; and
his own daughter, Ethelgiva, was placed in it as abbess.
With her many other noble ladies bound by the rules of the
monastic life, dwell in that monastery. These two edifices
were enriched by the king with much land, as well as personal
property.</p>

<p>These things being thus disposed of, the king began, as
was his practice, to consider within himself, what more he
could do to augment and show forth his piety; what he had
begun wisely, and thoughtfully conceived for the public
benefit, was adhered to with equally beneficial result; for
he had heard it out of the book of the law, that the
Lord had promised to restore to him tenfold; and he
knew that the Lord had kept his promise, and had actually
restored to him tenfold. Encouraged by this example, and
wishing to exceed the practices of his predecessors, he vowed
humbly and faithfully to devote to God half his services,
both day and night, and also half of all his wealth, such as
lawfully and justly came annually into his possession; and
this vow, as far as human discretion can perceive and keep,
he skilfully and wisely endeavoured to fulfil. But, that he
might, with his usual caution, avoid that which scripture
warns us against: "If you offer aright, but do not divide
aright, you sin," he considered how he might divide aright
that which he had vowed to God; and as Solomon had said,
"The heart of the king is in the hand of God," that is, his
counsel he ordered with wise policy, which could come only
from above, that his officers should first divide into two parts
the revenues of every year.</p>

<p>When this division was made, he assigned the first part to
worldly uses, and ordered that one-third of it should be paid
to his soldiers, and also to his ministers, the nobles who
dwelt at court where they discharged divers duties; for so
the king's family was arranged at all times into three classes.
The king's attendants were most wisely distributed into three
companies, so that the first company should be on duty at
court for one month, night and day, at the end of which they
returned to their homes, and were relieved by the second<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
company. At the end of the second month, in the same
way, the third company relieved the second, who returned to
their homes, where they spent two months, until their services
were again wanted. The third company also gave place
to the first in the same way, and also spent two months at
home. Thus was the threefold division of the companies arranged
at all times in the royal household.</p>

<p>To these therefore was paid the first of the three portions
aforesaid, to each according to their respective dignities and
peculiar services; the second to the operatives, whom he had
collected from every nation, and had about him in large numbers,
men skilled in every kind of construction; the third
portion was assigned to foreigners who came to him out of
every nation far and near, whether they asked money of him
or not, he cheerfully gave to each with wonderful munificence
according to their respective merits, according to what is
written: "God loveth a cheerful giver."</p>

<p>But the second part of all his revenues, which came yearly
into his possession, and was included in the receipts of the
exchequer, as we mentioned a little before, he, with ready devotion,
gave to God, ordering his ministers to divide it carefully
into four parts, on the condition that the first part should
be discreetly bestowed on the poor of every nation who came
to him; and on this subject he said that, as far as human
discretion could guarantee, the remark of pope St. Gregory
should be followed: "Give not much to whom you should
give little, nor little to whom much, nor something to whom
nothing, nor nothing to whom something." The second of
the four portions was given to the two monasteries which he
had built, and to those who therein had dedicated themselves
to God's service, as we have mentioned above. The third
portion was assigned to the school, which he had studiously
collected together, consisting of many of the nobility of his
own nation. The fourth portion was for the use of all
the neighbouring monasteries in all Saxony and Mercia, and
also during some years, in turn, to the churches and servants
of God dwelling in Britain [Wales], Cornwall, Gaul, Armorica,
Northumbria, and sometimes also in Ireland; according
to his means, he either distributed to them beforehand, or
afterwards, if life and success should not fail him.</p>

<p>When the king had arranged these matters, he remembered
that sentence of divine scripture, "Whosoever will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
give alms, ought to begin from himself," and prudently began
to reflect what he could offer to God from the service of
his body and mind; for he proposed to consecrate to God no
less out of this than he had done of things external to himself.
Moreover, he promised, as far as his infirmity and his
means would allow, to give up to God the half of his services,
bodily and mental, by night and by day, voluntarily,
and with all his might; but, inasmuch as he could not
equally distinguish the lengths of the hours by night, on account
of the darkness, and ofttimes of the day, on account of
the storms and clouds, he began to consider, by what means
and without any difficulty, relying on the mercy of God, he
might discharge the promised tenor of his vow until his
death.</p>

<p>After long reflection on these things, he at length, by a
useful and shrewd invention, commanded his chaplains to
supply wax in a sufficient quantity, and he caused it to be
weighed in such a manner that when there was so much of
it in the scales, as would equal the weight of seventy-two
pence,<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> he caused the chaplains to make six candles thereof,
each of equal length, so that each candle might have twelve
divisions<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> marked longitudinally upon it. By this plan,
therefore, those six candles burned for twenty-four hours, a
night and day, without fail, before the sacred relics of many
of God's elect, which always accompanied him wherever he
went; but sometimes when they would not continue burning
a whole day and night, till the same hour that they were
lighted the preceding evening, from the violence of the wind,
which blew day and night without intermission through the
doors and windows of the churches, the fissures of the divisions,
the plankings, or the wall, or the thin canvass of the
tents, they then unavoidably burned out and finished their
course before the appointed time; the king therefore considered
by what means he might shut out the wind, and so by
a useful and cunning invention, he ordered a lantern to be
beautifully constructed of wood and white ox-horn, which,
when skilfully planed till it is thin, is no less transparent
than a vessel of glass. This lantern, therefore, was wonderfully
made of wood and horn, as we before said, and by
night a candle was put into it, which shone as brightly without
as within, and was not extinguished by the wind; for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
opening of the lantern was also closed up, according to the
king's command, by a door made of horn.</p>

<p>By this contrivance, then, six candles, lighted in succession,
lasted four and twenty hours, neither more nor less, and,
when these were extinguished, others were lighted.</p>

<p>When all these things were properly arranged, the king,
eager to give up to God the half of his daily service, as he
had vowed, and more also, if his ability on the one hand,
and his malady on the other, would allow him, showed
himself a minute investigator of the truth in all his judgments,
and this especially for the sake of the poor, to whose
interest, day and night, among other duties of this life, he
ever was wonderfully attentive. For in the whole kingdom
the poor, besides him, had few or no protectors; for all the
powerful and noble of that country had turned their thoughts
rather to secular than to heavenly things: each was more
bent on secular matters, to his own profit, than on the public
good.</p>

<p>He strove also, in his own judgments, for the benefit of
both the noble and the ignoble, who often perversely quarrelled
at the meetings of his earls and officers, so that
hardly one of them admitted the justice of what had been
decided by the earls and prefects, and in consequence of
this pertinacious and obstinate dissension, all desired to
have the judgment of the king, and both sides sought at
once to gratify their desire. But if any one was conscious
of injustice on his side in the suit, though by law and
agreement he was compelled, however reluctant, to go before
the king, yet with his own good will he never would consent
to go. For he knew, that in the king's presence no part
of his wrong would be hidden; and no wonder, for the king
was a most acute investigator in passing sentence, as he was
in all other things. He inquired into almost all the judgments
which were given in his own absence, throughout all his
dominion, whether they were just or unjust. If he perceived
there was iniquity in those judgments, he summoned the
judges, either through his own agency, or through others of
his faithful servants, and asked them mildly, why they had
judged so unjustly; whether through ignorance or malevolence;
i.e., whether for the love or fear of any one, or hatred of
others; or also for the desire of money. At length, if the
judges acknowledged they had given judgment because they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
knew no better, he discreetly and moderately reproved their
inexperience and folly in such terms as these: "I wonder
truly at your insolence, that, whereas by God's favour and
mine, you have occupied the rank and office of the wise,
you have neglected the studies and labours of the wise.
Either, therefore, at once give up the discharge of the temporal
duties which you hold, or endeavour more zealously
to study the lessons of wisdom. Such are my commands."
At these words the earls and prefects would tremble
and endeavour to turn all their thoughts to the study of
justice, so that, wonderful to say, almost all his earls, prefects,
and officers, though unlearned from their cradles, were
sedulously bent upon acquiring learning, choosing rather laboriously
to acquire the knowledge of a new discipline than
to resign their functions; but if any one of them from old
age or slowness of talent was unable to make progress in
liberal studies, he commanded his son, if he had one, or
one of his kinsmen, or, if there was no other person to be
had, his own freedman or servant, whom he had some time
before advanced to the office of reading, to recite Saxon
books before him night and day, whenever he had any leisure,
and they lamented with deep sighs, in their inmost
hearts, that in their youth they had never attended to such
studies; and they blessed the young men of our days, who
happily could be instructed in the liberal arts, whilst they
execrated their own lot, that they had not learned these

<p>Whilst occupied on many and various studies, I happened
to light upon the History of the Kings of Britain, and
wondered that in the account which Gildas and Bede, in
their elegant treatises, had given of them, I found nothing
said of those kings who lived here before the Incarnation of
Christ, nor of Arthur, and many others who succeeded after
the Incarnation; though their actions both deserved immortal
fame, and were also celebrated by many people in a pleasant
manner and by heart, as if they had been written. Whilst
I was intent upon these and such like thoughts, Walter,
archdeacon of Oxford,<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> a man of great eloquence, and
learned in foreign histories, offered me a very ancient book
in the British tongue, which, in a continued regular story
and elegant style, related the actions of them all, from
Brutus the first king of the Britons, down to Cadwallader
the son of Cadwallo. At his request, therefore, though I
had not made fine language my study, by collecting florid
expressions from other authors, yet contented with my own
homely style, I undertook the translation of that book into
Latin. For if I had swelled the pages with rhetorical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
flourishes, I must have tired my readers, by employing their
attention more upon my words than upon the history. To
you, therefore, Robert earl of Gloucester, this work humbly
sues for the favour of being so corrected by your advice, that
it may not be thought to be the poor offspring of Geoffrey of
Monmouth, but when polished by your refined wit and
judgment, the production of him who had Henry the glorious
king of England for his father, and whom we see an
accomplished scholar and philosopher, as well as a brave
soldier and expert commander; so that Britain with joy
acknowledges, that in you she possesses another Henry.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. II.</span>&mdash;<i>The first inhabitants of Britain.</i></h3>


<p>Britain, the best of islands, is situated in the Western
Ocean, between France and Ireland, being eight hundred
miles long, and two hundred broad. It produces every
thing that is useful to man, with a plenty that never fails.
It abounds with all kinds of metal, and has plains of large
extent, and hills fit for the finest tillage, the richness of
whose soil affords variety of fruits in their proper seasons.
It has also forests well stored with all kinds of wild beasts;
in its lawns cattle find good change of pasture, and bees
variety of flowers for honey. Under its lofty mountains lie
green meadows pleasantly situated, in which the gentle
murmurs of crystal springs gliding along clear channels,
give those that pass an agreeable invitation to lie down on
their banks and slumber. It is likewise well watered with
lakes and rivers abounding with fish; and besides the
narrow sea which is on the Southern coast towards France,
there are three noble rivers, stretching out like three arms,
namely, the Thames, the Severn, and the Humber; by
which foreign commodities from all countries are brought
into it. It was formerly adorned with eight and twenty
cities,<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> of which some are in ruins and desolate, others
are still standing, beautified with lofty church-towers,
wherein religious worship is performed according to the
Christian institution. It is lastly inhabited by five different
nations, the Britons, Romans, Saxons, Picts, and Scots;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
whereof the Britons before the rest did formerly possess
the whole island from sea to sea, till divine vengeance,
punishing them for their pride, made them give way to
the Picts and Saxons. But in what manner, and from
whence, they first arrived here, remains now to be related
in what follows.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. III.</span>&mdash;<i>Brutus, being banished after the killing of his parents,
goes into Greece.</i></h3>


<p>After the Trojan war, &AElig;neas, flying with Ascanius from
the destruction of their city, sailed to Italy. There he was
honourably received by king Latinus, which raised against
him the envy of Turnus, king of the Rutuli, who thereupon
made war against him. Upon their engaging in battle,
&AElig;neas got the victory, and having killed Turnus, obtained
the kingdom of Italy, and with it Lavinia the daughter of
Latinus. After his death, Ascanius, succeeding in the
kingdom, built Alba upon the Tiber, and begat a son named
Sylvius, who, in pursuit of a private amour, took to wife a
niece of Lavinia. The damsel soon after conceived, and the
father Ascanius, coming to the knowledge of it, commanded
his magicians to consult of what sex the child should be.
When they had satisfied themselves in the matter, they told
him she would give birth to a boy, who would kill his father
and mother, and after travelling over many countries in
banishment, would at last arrive at the highest pitch of
glory. Nor were they mistaken in their prediction; for at
the proper time the woman brought forth a son, and died of
his birth; but the child was delivered to a nurse and called
Brutus.</p>

<p>At length, after fifteen years were expired, the youth
accompanied his father in hunting, and killed him undesignedly
by the shot of an arrow. For, as the servants
were driving up the deer towards them, Brutus, in shooting
at them, smote his father under the breast. Upon his death,
he was expelled from Italy, his kinsmen being enraged at
him for so heinous a deed. Thus banished he went into
Greece, where he found the posterity of Helenus, son of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
Priamus, kept in slavery by Pandrasus, king of the Greeks.
For, after the destruction of Troy, Pyrrhus, the son of
Achilles, had brought hither in chains Helenus and many
others; and to revenge on them the death of his father, had
given command that they should be held in captivity.
Brutus, finding they were by descent his old countrymen,
took up his abode among them, and began to distinguish
himself by his conduct and bravery in war, so as to gain the
affection of kings and commanders, and above all the young
men of the country. For he was esteemed a person of
great capacity both in council and war, and signalized his
generosity to his soldiers, by bestowing among them all the
money and spoil he got. His fame, therefore, spreading over
all countries, the Trojans from all parts began to flock to
him, desiring under his command to be freed from subjection
to the Greeks; which they assured him might easily be done,
considering how much their number was now increased in
the country, being seven thousand strong, besides women
and children. There was likewise then in Greece a noble
youth named Assaracus, a favourer of their cause. For he
was descended on his mother's side from the Trojans, and
placed great confidence in them, that he might be able by
their assistance to oppose the designs of the Greeks. For
his brother had a quarrel with him for attempting to deprive
him of three castles which his father had given him at his
death, on account of his being only the son of a concubine;
but as the brother was a Greek, both by his father's and
mother's side, he had prevailed with the king and the rest of
the Greeks to espouse his cause. Brutus, having taken a
view of the number of his men, and seen how Assaracus's
castles lay open to him, complied with their request.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>Being, therefore, chosen their commander, he assembled the
Trojans from all parts, and fortified the towns belonging to
Assaracus. But he himself, with Assaracus and the whole<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
body of men and women that adhered to him, retired to the
woods and hills, and then sent a letter to the king in these
words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Brutus, general of the remainder of the Trojans, to
Pandrasus, king of the Greeks, sends greeting. As it was
beneath the dignity of a nation descended from the illustrious
race of Dardanus, to be treated in your kingdom
otherwise than the nobility of their birth required, they
have betaken themselves to the protection of the woods.
For they have preferred living after the manner of wild
beasts, upon flesh and herbs, with the enjoyment of liberty,
to continuing longer in the greatest luxury under the yoke
of slavery. If this gives your majesty any offence, impute
it not to them, but pardon it; since it is the common sentiment
of every captive, to be desirous of regaining his former
dignity. Let pity therefore move you to bestow on them
freely their lost liberty, and permit them to inhabit the
thickest of the woods, to which they have retired to avoid
slavery. But if you deny them this favour, then by your
permission and assistance let them depart into some foreign
country."</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. V.</span>&mdash;<i>Brutus falling upon the forces of Pandrasus by surprise,
routs them, and takes Antigonus, the brother of Pandrasus, with Anacletus, prisoner.</i></h3>


<p>Pandrasus, perceiving the purport of the letter, was beyond
measure surprised at the boldness of such a message
from those whom he had kept in slavery; and having called
a council of his nobles, he determined to raise an army in
order to pursue them. But while he was upon his march to
the deserts, where he thought they were, and to the town of
Sparatinum, Brutus made a sally with three thousand men,
and fell upon him unawares. For having intelligence of his
coming, he had got into the town the night before, with a
design to break forth upon them unexpectedly, while unarmed
and marching without order. The sally being made,
the Trojans briskly attack them, and endeavour to make a
great slaughter. The Greeks, astonished, immediately give
way on all sides, and with the king at their head, hasten to
pass the river Akalon,<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> which runs near the place; but in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
passing are in great danger from the rapidity of the stream.
Brutus galls them in their flight, and kills some of them in
the stream, and some upon the banks; and running to and
fro, rejoices to see them in both places exposed to ruin.
But Antigonus, the brother of Pandrasus, grieved at this
sight, rallied his scattered troops, and made a quick return
upon the furious Trojans; for he rather chose to die making
a brave resistance, than to be drowned in a muddy pool in a
shameful flight. Thus attended with a close body of men,
he encouraged them to stand their ground, and employed
his whole force against the enemy with great vigour, but to
little or no purpose; for the Trojans had arms, but the others
none; and from this advantage they were more eager in the
pursuit, and made a miserable slaughter; nor did they give
over the assault till they had made nearly a total destruction,
and taken Antigonus, and Anacletus his companion
prisoners.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. VI.</span>&mdash;<i>The town of Sparatinum besieged by Pandrasus.</i></h3>


<p>Brutus, after the victory, reinforced the town with six hundred
men, and then retired to the woods, where the Trojan
people were expecting his protection. In the meantime
Pandrasus, grieving at his own flight and his brother's
captivity, endeavoured that night to re-assemble his broken
forces, and the next morning went with a body of his people
which he had got together, to besiege the town, into which
he supposed Brutus had put himself with Antigonus and the
rest of the prisoners that he had taken. As soon as he was
arrived at the walls, and had viewed the situation of the
castle, he divided his army into several bodies, and placed
them round it in different stations. One party was charged
not to suffer any of the besieged to go out; another to turn
the courses of the rivers; and a third to beat down the walls
with battering rams and other engines. In obedience to
those commands, they laboured with their utmost force to
distress the besieged; and night coming on, made choice of
their bravest men to defend their camp and tents from the
incursions of the enemy, while the rest, who were fatigued
with labour, refreshed themselves with sleep.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. VII.</span>&mdash;<i>The besieged ask assistance of Brutus.</i></h3>


<p>But the besieged, standing on the top of the walls, were no
less vigorous to repel the force of the enemies' engines, and
assault them with their own, and cast forth darts and firebrands
with a unanimous resolution to make a valiant defence.
And when a breach was made through the wall,
they compelled the enemy to retire, by throwing upon them
fire and scalding water. But being distressed through
scarcity of provision and daily labour, they sent an urgent
message to Brutus, to hasten to their assistance, for they
were afraid they might be so weakened as to be obliged to
quit the town. Brutus, though desirous of relieving them,
was under great perplexity, as he had not men enough to
stand a pitched battle, and therefore made use of a stratagem,
by which he proposed to enter the enemies' camp by
night, and having deceived their watch to kill them in their
sleep. But because he knew this was impracticable without
the concurrence and assistance of some Greeks, he called to
him Anacletus, the companion of Antigonus, and with a
drawn sword in his hand, spake to him after this manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Noble youth! your own and Antigonus's life is now at
an end, unless you will faithfully perform what I command
you. This night I design to invade the camp of the Greeks,
and fall upon them unawares, but am afraid of being hindered
in the attempt if the watch should discover the stratagem.
Since it will be necessary, therefore, to have them
killed first, I desire to make use of you to deceive them, that
I may have the easier access to the rest. Do you therefore
manage this affair cunningly. At the second hour of the
night go to the watch, and with fair speeches tell them that
you have brought away Antigonus from prison, and that he
is come to the bottom of the woods, where he lies hid among
the shrubs, and cannot get any farther, by reason of the
fetters with which you shall pretend that he is bound.
Then you shall conduct them, as if it were to deliver him,
to the end of the wood, where I will attend with a band of
men ready to kill them."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. VIII.</span>&mdash;<i>Anacletus, in fear of death, betrays the army of the Greeks.</i></h3>


<p>Anacletus, seeing the sword threatening him with immediate
death while these words were being pronounced, was
so terrified as to promise upon oath, that on condition he
and Antigonus should have longer life granted them, he
would execute his command. Accordingly, the agreement
being confirmed, at the second hour of the night he directs
his way towards the Grecian camp, and when he was come
near to it, the watch, who were then narrowly examining all
the places where any one could hide, ran out from all parts
to meet him, and demanded the occasion of his coming, and
whether it was not to betray the army. He, with a show of
great joy, made the following answer:&mdash;"I come not to betray
my country, but having made my escape from the prison
of the Trojans, I fly thither to desire you would go with me
to Antigonus, whom I have delivered from Brutus's chains.
For being not able to come with me for the weight of his
fetters, I have a little while ago caused him to lie hid among
the shrubs at the end of the wood, till I could meet with
some one whom I might conduct to his assistance." While
they were in suspense about the truth of this story, there
came one who knew him, and after he had saluted him, told
them who he was; so that now, without any hesitation, they
quickly called their absent companions, and followed him to
the wood where he had told them Antigonus lay hid. But
at length, as they were going among the shrubs, Brutus with
his armed bands springs forth, and falls upon them, while
under the greatest astonishment, with a most cruel slaughter.
From thence he marches directly to the siege, and divides
his men into three bands, assigning to each of them a different
part of the camp, and telling them to advance discreetly,
and without noise; and when entered, not to kill
any body till he with his company should be possessed of
the king's tent, and should cause the trumpet to sound for a
signal.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. IX.</span>&mdash;<i>The taking of Pandrasus.</i></h3>


<p>When he had given them these instructions, they forthwith
softly entered the camp in silence, and taking their appointed
stations, awaited the promised signal, which Brutus delayed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
not to give as soon as he had got before the tent of Pandrasus,
to assault which was the thing he most desired. At
hearing the signal, they forthwith draw their swords, enter
in among the men in their sleep, make quick destruction of
them, and allowing no quarter, in this manner traverse the
whole camp. The rest, awaked at the groans of the dying,
and seeing their assailants, were like sheep seized with a
sudden fear; for they despaired of life, since they had
neither time to take arms, nor to escape by flight. They
run up and down without arms among the armed, whithersoever
the fury of the assault hurries them, but are on all
sides cut down by the enemy rushing in. Some that might
have escaped, were in the eagerness of flight dashed against
rocks, trees, or shrubs, and increased the misery of their
death. Others, that had only a shield, or some such covering
for their defence, in venturing upon the same rocks to
avoid death, fell down in the hurry and darkness of the
night, and broke either legs or arms. Others, that escaped
both these disasters, but did not know whither to fly, were
drowned in the adjacent rivers; and scarcely one got away
without some unhappy accident befalling him. Besides, the
garrison in the town, upon notice of the coming of their
fellow soldiers, sallied forth, and redoubled the slaughter.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. X.</span>&mdash;<i>A consultation about what is to be asked of the captive king.</i></h3>


<p>But Brutus, as I said before, having possessed himself of
the king's tent, made it his business to keep him a safe prisoner;
for he knew he could more easily attain his ends by
preserving his life than by killing him; but the party that
was with him, allowing no quarter, made an utter destruction
in that part which they had gained. The night being
spent in this manner, when the next morning discovered to
their view so great an overthrow of the enemy, Brutus, in
transports of joy, gave full liberty to his men to do what
they pleased with the plunder, and then entered the town
with the king, to stay there till they had shared it among
them; which done, he again fortified the castle, gave orders
for burying the slain, and retired with his forces to the
woods in great joy for the victory. After the rejoicings of
his people on this occasion, their renowned general sum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>moned
the oldest of them and asked their advice, what he
had best desire of Pandrasus, who, being now in their
power, would readily grant whatever they would request of
him, in order to regain his liberty. They, according to
their different fancies, desired different things; some urged
him to request that a certain part of the kingdom might be
assigned them for their habitation; others that he would
demand leave to depart, and to be supplied with necessaries
for their voyage. After they had been a long time in
suspense what to do, one of them, named Mempricius, rose
up, and having made silence, spoke to them thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What can be the occasion of your suspense, fathers, in a
matter which I think so much concerns your safety? The
only thing you can request, with any prospect of a firm
peace and security to yourselves and your posterity, is
liberty to depart. For if you make no better terms with
Pandrasus for his life than only to have some part of the
country assigned you to live among the Greeks, you will
never enjoy a lasting peace while the brothers, sons, or
grandsons of those whom you killed yesterday shall continue
to be your neighbours. So long as the memory of their
fathers' deaths shall remain, they will be your mortal enemies,
and upon the least trifling provocation will endeavour
to revenge themselves. Nor will you be sufficiently numerous
to withstand so great a multitude of people. And if
you shall happen to fall out among yourselves, their number
will daily increase, yours diminish. I propose, therefore,
that you request of him his eldest daughter, Ignoge, for a
wife for our general, and with her, gold, silver, corn, and
whatever else shall be necessary for our voyage. If we
obtain this, we may with his leave remove to some other
country."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XI.</span>&mdash;<i>Pandrasus gives his daughter Ignoge in marriage to Brutus,
who, after his departure from Greece, falls upon a desert island, where
he is told by the oracle of Diana what place he is to inhabit.</i></h3>


<p>When he had ended his speech, in words to this effect, the
whole assembly acquiesced in his advice, and moved that
Pandrasus might be brought in among them, and condemned
to a most cruel death unless he would grant this request.
He was immediately brought in, and being placed in a chair<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
above the rest, and informed of the tortures prepared for
him unless he would do what was commanded him, he made
them this answer:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Since my ill fate has delivered me and my brother Antigonus
into your hands, I can do no other than grant your
request, lest a refusal may cost us our lives, which are now
entirely in your power. In my opinion life is preferable to
all other considerations; therefore, wonder not that I am
willing to redeem it at so great a price. But though it is
against my inclination that I obey your commands, yet it
seems matter of comfort to me that I am to give my daughter
to so noble a youth, whose descent from the illustrious
race of Priamus and Anchises is clear, both from that greatness
of mind which appears in him, and the certain accounts
we have had of it. For who less than he could have released
from their chains the banished Trojans, when reduced
under slavery to so many great princes? Who else could
have encouraged them to make head against the Greeks? or
with so small a body of men vanquished so numerous and
powerful an army, and taken their king prisoner in the
engagement? And, therefore, since this noble youth has
gained so much glory by the opposition which he has made
to me, I give him my daughter Ignoge, and also gold, silver,
ships, corn, wine, and oil, and whatever you shall find necessary
for your voyage. If you shall alter your resolution,
and think fit to continue among the Greeks, I will grant you
the third part of my kingdom for your habitation; if not,
I will faithfully perform my promise, and for your greater
security will stay as a hostage among you till I have made
it good."</p>

<p>Accordingly he held a council, and directed messengers to
all the shores of Greece, to get ships together; which done,
he delivered them to the Trojans, to the number of three
hundred and twenty-four, laden with all kinds of provision,
and married his daughter to Brutus. He made also a present
of gold and silver to each man according to his quality.
When everything was performed the king was set at liberty;
and the Trojans, now released from his power, set sail with
a fair wind. But Ignoge, standing upon the stern of the
ship, swooned away several times in Brutus's arms, and with
many sighs and tears lamented the leaving her parents and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
country, nor ever turned her eyes from the shore while it
was in sight. Brutus, meanwhile, endeavoured to assuage
her grief by kind words and embraces intermixed with
kisses, and ceased not from these blandishments till she
grew weary of crying and fell asleep. During these and
other accidents, the winds continued fair for two days and a
night together, when at length they arrived at a certain
island called Leogecia, which had been formerly wasted by
the incursions of pirates, and was then uninhabited. Brutus,
not knowing this, sent three hundred armed men ashore
to see who inhabited it; but they finding nobody, killed
several kinds of wild beasts which they met with in the
groves and woods, and came to a desolate city, in which they
found a temple of Diana, and in it a statue of that goddess
which gave answers to those that came to consult her. At
last, loading themselves with the prey which they had taken
in hunting, they return to their ships, and give their companions
an account of this country and city. Then they
advised their leader to go to the city, and after offering
sacrifices, to inquire of the deity of the place, what country
was allotted them for their place of settlement. To this
proposal all assented; so that Brutus, attended with Gerion,
the augur, and twelve of the oldest men, set forward to the
temple, with all things necessary for the sacrifice. Being
arrived at the place, and presenting themselves before the
shrine with garlands about their temples, as the ancient
rites required, they made three fires to the three deities,
Jupiter, Mercury, and Diana, and offered sacrifices to each
of them. Brutus himself, holding before the altar of the
goddess a consecrated vessel filled with wine, and the blood
of a white hart, with his face looking up to the image, broke
silence in these words:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left:6em;">
"Diva potens nemorum, terror sylvestribus apris;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Cui licet amfractus ire per &aelig;thereos,</span><br />
Infernasque domos; terrestria jura resolve,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Et dic quas terras nos habitare velis?</span><br />
Dic certam sedem qua te venerabor in &aelig;vum,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Qua tibi virgineis templa dicabo choris?"</span><br />
<br />
Goddess of woods, tremendous in the chase<br />
To mountain boars, and all the savage race!<br />
Wide o'er the ethereal walks extends thy sway,<br />
And o'er the infernal mansions void of day!<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>Look upon us on earth! unfold our fate,<br />
And say what region is our destined seat?<br />
Where shall we next thy lasting temples raise?<br />
And choirs of virgins celebrate thy praise?<br />
</p>

<p>These words he repeated nine times, after which he took
four turns round the altar, poured the wine into the fire, and
then laid himself down upon the hart's skin, which he had
spread before the altar, where he fell asleep. About the
third hour of the night, the usual time for deep sleep, the
goddess seemed to present herself before him, and foretell
his future success as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left:6em;">
"Brute! sub occasum solis trans Gallica regna<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Insula in oceano est undique clausa mari:</span><br />
Insula in oceano est habitata gigantibus olim,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nunc deserta quidem, gentibus apta tuis.</span><br />
Hanc pete, namque tibi sedes erit illa perennis:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sic fiet natis altera Troja tuis.</span><br />
Sic de prole tua reges nascentur: et ipsis<br />

<br />
Brutus! there lies beyond the Gallic bounds<br />
An island which the western sea surrounds,<br />
By giants once possessed; now few remain<br />
To bar thy entrance, or obstruct thy reign.<br />
To reach that happy shore thy sails employ;<br />
There fate decrees to raise a second Troy,<br />
And found an empire in thy royal line,<br />
Which time shall ne'er destroy, nor bounds confine.<br />
</p>

<p>Awakened by the vision, he was for some time in doubt
with himself, whether what he had seen was a dream or a
real appearance of the goddess herself, foretelling to what
land he should go. At last he called to his companions, and
related to them in order the vision he had in his sleep, at
which they very much rejoiced, and were urgent to return
to their ships, and while the wind favoured them, to hasten
their voyage towards the west, in pursuit of what the goddess
had promised. Without delay, therefore, they returned
to their company, and set sail again, and after a course of
thirty days came to Africa, being ignorant as yet whither to
steer. From thence they came to the Philenian altars, and
to a place called Salin&aelig;, and sailed between Ruscicada and
the mountains of Azara,<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> where they underwent great dan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>ger

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XII.</span>&mdash;<i>Brutus enters Aquitaine with Corineus.</i></h3>


<p>From thence, passing the river Malua, they arrived at
Mauritania, where at last, for want of provisions, they
were obliged to go ashore; and, dividing themselves into
several bands, they laid waste the whole country. When
they had well stored their ships, they steered to the Pillars
of Hercules, where they saw some of those sea monsters,
called Syrens, which surrounded their ships, and very nearly
overturned them. However, they made a shift to escape,
and came to the Tyrrhenian Sea, upon the shores of which
they found four several nations descended from the banished
Trojans, that had accompanied Antenor<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> in his flight. The
name of their commander was Corineus, a modest man in
matters of council, and of great courage and boldness, who,
in an encounter with any person, even of gigantic stature,
would immediately overthrow him, as if he were a child.
When they understood from whom he was descended, they
joined company with him and those under his government,
who from the name of their leader were afterwards called
the Cornish people, and indeed were more serviceable to
Brutus than the rest in all his engagements. From thence
they came to Aquitaine, and entering the mouth of the
Loire, cast anchor. There they stayed seven days and
viewed the country. Goffarius Pictus, who was king of
Aquitaine at that time, having an account brought him of
the arrival of a foreign people with a great fleet upon his
coasts, sent ambassadors to them to demand whether they
brought with them peace or war. The ambassadors, on
their way towards the fleet, met Corineus, who was come
out with two hundred men, to hunt in the woods. They
demanded of him, who gave him leave to enter the king's
forests, and kill his game; (which by an ancient law nobody
was allowed to do without leave from the prince.) Corineus
answered, that as for that matter there was no occasion for
asking leave; upon which one of them, named Imbertus,
rushing forward, with a full drawn bow levelled a shot at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
him. Corineus avoids the arrow and immediately runs up
to him, and with his bow in his hand breaks his head. The
rest narrowly escaped, and carried the news of this disaster
to Goffarius. The Pictavian general was struck with sorrow
for it, and immediately raised a vast army, to revenge the
death of his ambassador. Brutus, on the other hand, upon
hearing the rumour of his coming, sends away the women
and children to the ships, which he took care to be well
guarded, and commands them to stay there, while he, with
the rest that were able to bear arms, should go to meet the
army. At last an assault being made, a bloody fight ensued:
in which after a great part of the day had been spent, Corineus
was ashamed to see the Aquitanians so bravely stand
their ground, and the Trojans maintaining the fight without
victory. He therefore takes fresh courage, and drawing off
his men to the right wing, breaks in upon the very thickest
of the enemies, where he made such slaughter on every side,
that at last he broke the line and put them all to flight. In
this encounter he lost his sword, but by good fortune, met
with a battle-axe, with which he clave down to the waist
every one that stood in his way. Brutus and every body
else, both friends and enemies, were amazed at his courage
and strength, for he brandished about his battle-axe among
the flying troops, and terrified them not a little with these
insulting words, "Whither fly ye, cowards? whither fly ye,
base wretches? stand your ground, that ye may encounter
Corineus. What! for shame! do so many thousands of you
fly one man? However, take this comfort for your flight,
that you are pursued by one, before whom the Tyrrhenian
giants could not stand their ground, but fell down slain in
heaps together."</p>

<p>At these words one of them, named Subardus, who was a
consul, returns with three hundred men to assault him; but
Corineus with his shield wards off the blow, and lifting up
his battle-axe gave him such a stroke upon the top of his
helmet, that at once he clave him down to the waist; and
then rushing upon the rest he made terrible slaughter by
wheeling about his battle-axe among them, and, running to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
and fro, seemed more anxious to inflict blows on the enemy
than careful to avoid those which they aimed at him. Some
had their hands and arms, some their very shoulders, some
again their heads, and others their legs cut off by him. All
fought with him only, and he alone seemed to fight with all.
Brutus seeing him thus beset, out of regard to him, runs
with a band of men to his assistance: at which the battle is
again renewed with vigour and with loud shouts, and great
numbers slain on both sides. But now the Trojans presently
gain the victory, and put Goffarius with his Pictavians to
flight. The king after a narrow escape went to several
parts of Gaul, to procure succours among such princes as
were related or known to him. At that time Gaul was subject
to twelve princes, who with equal authority possessed the
whole country. These receive him courteously, and promise
with one consent to expel the foreigners from Aquitaine.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XIV.</span>&mdash;<i>Brutus, after his victory with Goffarius, ravages Aquitaine
with fire and sword.</i></h3>


<p>Brutus, in joy for the victory, enriches his men with the
spoils of the slain, and then, dividing them into several
bodies, marches into the country with a design to lay it
waste, and load his fleet with the spoil. With this view
he sets the cities on fire, seizes the riches that were in them,
destroys the fields, and makes dreadful slaughter among the
citizens and common people, being unwilling to leave so
much as one alive of that wretched nation. While he was
making this destruction over all Aquitaine, he came to a
place where the city of Tours now stands, which he afterwards
built, as Homer testifies. As soon as he had looked
out a place convenient for the purpose, he pitched his camp
there, for a place of safe retreat, when occasion should require.
For he was afraid on account of Goffarius's approach
with the kings and princes of Gaul, and a very great army,
which was now come near the place, ready to give him
battle. Having therefore finished his camp, he expected to
engage with Goffarius in two days' time, placing the utmost
confidence in the conduct and courage of the young men
under his command.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XV.</span>&mdash;<i>Goffarius's fight with Brutus.</i></h3>


<p>Goffarius, being informed that the Trojans were in those
parts, marched day and night, till he came within a close
view of Brutus's camp; and then with a stern look and
disdainful smile, broke out into these expressions, "Oh
wretched fate! Have these base exiles made a camp also
in my kingdom? Arm, arm, soldiers, and march through
their thickest ranks: we shall soon take these pitiful fellows
like sheep, and disperse them throughout our kingdom for
slaves." At these words they prepared their arms, and advanced
in twelve bodies towards the enemy. Brutus, on the
other hand, with his forces drawn up in order, went forth
boldly to meet them, and gave his men directions for their
conduct, where they should assault and where they should
be upon the defensive. At the beginning of the attack, the
Trojans had the advantage, and made a rapid slaughter of
the enemy, of whom there fell near two thousand, which so
terrified the rest, that they were on the point of running
away. But, as the victory generally falls to that side which
has very much the superiority in numbers, so the Gauls,
being three to one in number, though overpowered at first,
yet at last joining in a great body together, broke in upon
the Trojans, and forced them to retire to their camp with
much slaughter. The victory thus gained, they besieged
them in their camp, with a design not to suffer them to stir
out until they should either surrender themselves prisoners,
or be cruelly starved to death with a long famine.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Corineus the night following entered
into consultation with Brutus, and proposed to go out that
night by by-ways, and conceal himself in an adjacent wood
till break of day; and while Brutus should sally forth upon
the enemy in the morning twilight, he with his company
would surprise them from behind and put them to slaughter.
Brutus was pleased with this stratagem of Corineus, who
according to his engagement got out cunningly with three
thousand men, and put himself under the covert of the
woods. As soon as it was day Brutus marshalled his men
and opened the camp to go out to fight. The Gauls meet
him and begin the engagement: many thousands fall on
both sides, neither party giving quarter. There was present<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
a Trojan, named Turonus, the nephew of Brutus, inferior to
none but Corineus in courage and strength of body. He
alone with his sword killed six hundred men, but at last was
unfortunately slain himself by the number of Gauls that
rushed upon him. From him the city of Tours derived its
name, because he was buried there. While both armies
were thus warmly engaged, Corineus came upon them unawares,
and fell fiercely upon the rear of the enemy, which
put new courage into his friends on the other side, and made
them exert themselves with increased vigour. The Gauls
were astonished at the very shout of Corineus's men, and
thinking their number to be much greater than it really was,
they hastily quitted the field; but the Trojans pursued them,
and killed them in the pursuit, nor did they desist till they
had gained a complete victory. Brutus, though in joy for
this great success, was yet afflicted to observe the number of
his forces daily lessened, while that of the enemy increased
more and more. He was in suspense for some time, whether
he had better continue the war or not, but at last he determined
to return to his ships while the greater part of his
followers was yet safe, and hitherto victorious, and to go in
quest of the island which the goddess had told him of. So
without further delay, with the consent of his company, he
repaired to the fleet, and loading it with the riches and
spoils he had taken, set sail with a fair wind towards the
promised island, and arrived on the coast of Totness.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XVI.</span>&mdash;<i>Albion divided between Brutus and Corineus.</i></h3>


<p>The island was then called Albion,<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> and was inhabited by
none but a few giants. Notwithstanding this, the pleasant
situation of the places, the plenty of rivers abounding with
fish, and the engaging prospect of its woods, made Brutus
and his company very desirous to fix their habitation in it.
They therefore passed through all the provinces, forced the
giants to fly into the caves of the mountains, and divided the
country among them according to the directions of their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
commander. After this they began to till the ground and
build houses, so that in a little time the country looked like
a place that had been long inhabited. At last Brutus called
the island after his own name Britain, and his companions
Britons; for by these means he desired to perpetuate the
memory of his name. From whence afterwards the language
of the nation, which at first bore the name of Trojan,
or rough Greek, was called British. But Corineus, in
imitation of his leader, called that part of the island which
fell to his share, Corinea, and his people Corineans, after his
name; and though he had his choice of the provinces before
all the rest, yet he preferred this country, which is now
called in Latin Cornubia, either from its being in the shape
of a horn (in Latin Cornu), or from the corruption of the
said name.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> For it was a diversion to him to encounter the
said giants, which were in greater numbers there than in all
the other provinces that fell to the share of his companions.
Among the rest was one detestable monster, named Go&euml;magot,
in stature twelve cubits, and of such prodigious strength
that at one shake he pulled up an oak as if it had been a
hazel wand. On a certain day, when Brutus was holding a
solemn festival to the gods, in the port where they at first
landed, this giant with twenty more of his companions came
in upon the Britons, among whom he made a dreadful
slaughter. But the Britons at last assembling together in a
body, put them to the rout, and killed them every one but
Go&euml;magot. Brutus had given orders to have him preserved
alive, out of a desire to see a combat between him and Corineus,
who took a great pleasure in such encounters. Corineus,
overjoyed at this, prepared himself, and throwing
aside his arms, challenged him to wrestle with him. At the
beginning of the encounter, Corineus and the giant, standing,
front to front, held each other strongly in their arms,
and panted aloud for breath; but Go&euml;magot presently grasping
Corineus with all his might, broke three of his ribs, two
on his right side and one on his left. At which Corineus,
highly enraged, roused up his whole strength, and snatching
him upon his shoulders, ran with him, as fast as the weight
would allow him, to the next shore, and there getting upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
the top of a high rock, hurled down the savage monster into
the sea; where falling on the sides of craggy rocks, he was
torn to pieces, and coloured the waves with his blood. The
place where he fell, taking its name from the giant's fall,
is called Lam Go&euml;magot, that is, Go&euml;magot's Leap, to this
day.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XVII.</span>&mdash;<i>The building of new Troy by Brutus, upon the river
Thames.</i></h3>


<p>Brutus, having thus at last set eyes upon his kingdom,
formed a design of building a city, and with this view, travelled
through the land to find out a convenient situation,
and coming to the river Thames, he walked along the shore,
and at last pitched upon a place very fit for his purpose.
Here, therefore, he built a city, which he called New Troy;
under which name it continued a long time after, till at last,
by the corruption of the original word, it come to be called
Trinovantum. But afterwards when Lud, the brother of
Cassibellaun, who made war against Julius C&aelig;sar, obtained
the government of the kingdom, he surrounded it with
stately walls, and towers of admirable workmanship, and
ordered it to be called after his name, Kaer-Lud, that is, the
City of Lud.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> But this very thing became afterwards the
occasion of a great quarrel between him and his brother
Nennius, who took offence at his abolishing the name of
Troy in this country. Of this quarrel Gildas the historian
has given a full account; for which reason I pass it over, for
fear of debasing by my account of it, what so great a writer
has so eloquently related.</p>

<h3>BOOK II.</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. I.</span>&mdash;<i>After the death of Brutus, his three sons succeed him in the
kingdom.</i></h3>


<p>During these transactions, Brutus had by his wife Ignoge
three famous sons, whose names were Locrin, Albanact, and
Kamber. These, after their father's death, which happened
in the twenty-fourth year after his arrival, buried him in the
city which he had built, and then having divided the kingdom
of Britain among them, retired each to his government.
Locrin, the eldest, possessed the middle part of the island,
called afterwards from his name, Loegria. Kamber had that
part which lies beyond the river Severn, now called Wales,
but which was for a long time named Kambria; and hence
that people still call themselves in their British tongue Kambri.
Albanact, the younger brother, possessed the country
he called Albania, now Scotland. After they had a long
time reigned in peace together, Humber, king of the Huns,
arrived in Albania, and having killed Albanact in battle,
forced his people to fly to Locrin for protection.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. II.</span>&mdash;<i>Locrin, having routed Humber, falls in love with Estrildis.</i></h3>


<p>Locrin, at hearing this news, joined his brother Kamber,
and went with the whole strength of the kingdom to meet
the king of the Huns, near the river now called Humber,
where he gave him battle, and put him to the rout. Humber
made towards the river in his flight, and was drowned in it,
on account of which it has since borne his name. Locrin,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
after the victory, bestowed the plunder of the enemy upon
his own men, reserving for himself the gold and silver
which he found in the ships, together with three virgins of
admirable beauty, whereof one was the daughter of a king
in Germany, whom with the other two Humber had forcibly
brought away with him, after he had ruined their country.
Her name was Estrildis, and her beauty such as was hardly
to be matched. No ivory or new-fallen snow, no lily could
exceed the whiteness of her skin. Locrin, smitten with
love, would have gladly married her, at which Corineus was
extremely incensed, on account of the engagement which
Locrin had entered into with him to marry his daughter.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. III.</span>&mdash;<i>Corineus resents the affront put upon his daughter.</i></h3>


<p>He went, therefore, to the king, and wielding a battle-axe
in his right hand, vented his rage against him in these
words: "Do you thus reward me, Locrin, for the many
wounds which I have suffered under your father's command
in his wars with strange nations, that you must slight my
daughter, and debase yourself to marry a barbarian?
While there is strength in this right hand, that has been destructive
to so many giants upon the Tyrrhenian coasts, I
will never put up with this affront." And repeating this
again and again with a loud voice, he shook his battle-axe
as if he was going to strike him, till the friends of both
interposed, and after they had appeased Corineus, obliged
Locrin to perform his agreement.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. IV.</span>&mdash;<i>Locrin at last marries Guendol&oelig;na, the daughter of
Corineus.</i></h3>


<p>Locrin therefore married Corineus's daughter, named
Guendol&oelig;na, yet still retained his love for Estrildis, for
whom he made apartments under ground, in which he
entertained her, and caused her to be honourably attended.
For he was resolved at least to carry on a private amour
with her, since he could not live with her openly for fear of
Corineus. In this manner he concealed her, and made
frequent visits to her for seven years together, without the
privity of any but his most intimate domestics; and all
under a pretence of performing some secret sacrifices to his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
gods, by which he imposed on the credulity of every body.
In the meantime Estrildis became with child, and was
delivered of a most beautiful daughter, whom she named
Sabre. Guendol&oelig;na was also with child, and brought forth
a son, who was named Maddan, and put under the care of
his grandfather Corineus to be educated.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. V.</span>&mdash;<i>Locrin is killed; Estrildis and Sabre are thrown into a
river.</i></h3>


<p>But in process of time, when Corineus was dead, Locrin
divorced Guendol&oelig;na, and advanced Estrildis to be queen.
Guendol&oelig;na, provoked beyond measure at this, retired into
Cornwall, where she assembled together all the forces of that
kingdom, and began to raise disturbances against Locrin.
At last both armies joined battle near the river Sture, where
Locrin was killed by the shot of an arrow. After his death,
Guendol&oelig;na took upon her the government of the whole
kingdom, retaining her father's furious spirit. For she
commanded Estrildis and her daughter Sabre to be thrown
into the river now called the Severn, and published an edict
through all Britain, that the river should bear the damsel's
name, hoping by this to perpetuate her memory, and by that
the infamy of her husband. So that to this day the river is
called in the British tongue Sabren, which by the corruption
of the name is in another language Sabrina.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. VI.</span>&mdash;<i>Guendol&oelig;na delivers up the kingdom to Maddan, her son,

<p>Guendol&oelig;na reigned fifteen years after the death of
Locrin, who had reigned ten, and then advanced her son
Maddan (whom she saw now at maturity) to the throne,
contenting herself with the country of Cornwall for the
remainder of her life. At this time Samuel the prophet
governed in Jud&aelig;a, Sylvius &AElig;neas was yet living, and
Homer was esteemed a famous orator and poet.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> Maddan,

Mempricius and Malim, and ruled the kingdom in peace and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
with care forty years. As soon as he was dead, the two
brothers quarrelled for the kingdom, each being ambitious
of the sovereignty of the whole island. Mempricius,
impatient to attain his ends, enters into treaty with Malim,
under colour of making a composition with him, and, having
formed a conspiracy, murdered him in the assembly where
their ambassadors were met. By these means he obtained
the dominion of the whole island, over which he exercised
such tyranny, that he left scarcely a nobleman alive in it,
and either by violence or treachery oppressed every one that
he apprehended might be likely to succeed him, pursuing his
hatred to his whole race. He also deserted his own wife, by
whom he had a noble youth named Ebraucus, and addicted
himself to sodomy, preferring unnatural lust to the pleasures
of the conjugal state. At last, in the twentieth year of his
reign, while he was hunting, he retired from his company
into a valley, where he was surrounded by a great multitude
of ravenous wolves, and devoured by them in a horrible
manner. Then did Saul reign in Jud&aelig;a, and Eurystheus in
Laced&aelig;monia.</p>

surnamed Greenshield, Margadud, Sisillius, Regin, Morivid,
Bladud, Lagon, Bodloan, Kincar, Spaden, Gaul, Darden,
Eldad, Ivor, Gangu, Hector, Kerin, Rud, Assarach, Buel.
The names of his daughters were, Gloigni, Ignogni, Oudas,
Guenliam, Gaudid, Angarad, Guendoloe, Tangustel, Gorgon,
Medlan, Methahel, Ourar, Malure, Kambreda, Ragan, Gael,
Ecub, Nest, Cheum, Stadud, Gladud, Ebren, Blagan,
Aballac, Angaes, Galaes, (the most celebrated beauty at
that time in Britain or Gaul,) Edra, Anaor, Stadial, Egron.
All these daughters their father sent into Italy to Sylvius
Alba, who reigned after Sylvius Latinus, where they were
married among the Trojan nobility, the Latin and Sabine
women refusing to associate with them. But the sons,
under the conduct of their brother Assaracus, departed
in a fleet to Germany, and having, with the assistance
of Sylvius Alba, subdued the people there, obtained that
kingdom.</p>

<p>But Brutus, surnamed Greenshield, stayed with his father,
whom he succeeded in the government, and reigned twelve
years. After him reigned Leil, his son, a peaceful and just
prince, who, enjoying a prosperous reign, built in the north
of Britain a city, called by his name, Kaerleil;<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> at the same
time that Solomon began to build the temple of Jerusalem,
and the queen of Sheba came to hear his wisdom; at which
time also Sylvius Epitus succeeded his father Alba, in Italy.
Leil reigned twenty-five years, but towards the latter end of
his life grew more remiss in his government, so that his
neglect of affairs speedily occasioned a civil dissension in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
kingdom. After him reigned his son, Hudibras, thirty-nine
years, and composed the civil dissension among his people.
He built Kaerlem or Canterbury, Kaerguen or Winchester,
and the town of Mount Paladur, now Shaftesbury. At this
place an eagle spoke, while the wall of the town was being
built; and indeed I should have transmitted the speech to
posterity, had I thought it true, as the rest of the history. At
this time reigned Capys, the son of Epitus; and Haggai,
Amos, Joel, and Azariah, were prophets in Israel.</p>

<p>Next succeeded Bladud, his son, and reigned twenty years.
He built Kaerbadus, now Bath, and made hot baths in it
for the benefit of the public, which he dedicated to the goddess
Minerva; in whose temple he kept fires that never went
out nor consumed to ashes, but as soon as they began to decay
were turned into balls of stone. About this time the
prophet Elias prayed that it might not rain upon earth; and
it did not rain for three years and six months. This prince
was a very ingenious man, and taught necromancy in his
kingdom, nor did he leave off pursuing his magical operations,
till he attempted to fly to the upper region of the air with
wings which he had prepared, and fell down upon the temple

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XI.</span>&mdash;<i>Leir the son of Bladud, having no son, divides his kingdom
among his daughters.</i></h3>


<p>After this unhappy fate of Bladud, Leir,<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> his son was
advanced to the throne, and nobly governed his country sixty
years. He built upon the river Sore a city, called in the
British tongue, Kaerleir, in the Saxon, Leircestre.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> He
was without male issue, but had three daughters, whose
names were Gonorilla, Regau, and Cordeilla, of whom he
was dotingly fond, but especially of his youngest, Cordeilla.
When he began to grow old, he had thoughts of dividing his
kingdom among them, and of bestowing them on such
husbands as were fit to be advanced to the government with
them. But to make trial who was worthy to have the best<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
part of his kingdom, he went to each of them to ask which
of them loved him most. The question being proposed,
Gonorilla, the eldest, made answer, "That she called heaven
to witness, she loved him more than her own soul." The
father replied, "Since you have preferred my declining age
before your own life, I will marry you, my dearest daughter,
to whomsoever you shall make choice of, and give with you
the third part of my kingdom." Then Regau, the second
daughter, willing, after the example of her sister, to prevail
upon her father's good nature, answered with an oath, "That
she could not otherwise express her thoughts, but that she
loved him above all creatures." The credulous father upon
this made her the same promise that he did to her eldest
sister, that is, the choice of a husband, with the third part of
his kingdom. But Cordeilla, the youngest, understanding
how easily he was satisfied with the flattering expressions of
her sisters, was desirous to make trial of his affection after a
different manner. "My father," said she, "is there any
daughter that can love her father more than duty requires?
In my opinion, whoever pretends to it, must disguise her
real sentiments under the veil of flattery. I have always
loved you as a father, nor do I yet depart from my purposed
duty; and if you insist to have something more extorted
from me, hear now the greatness of my affection, which I
always bear you, and take this for a short answer to all your
questions; look how much you have, so much is your value,
and so much do I love you." The father, supposing that she
spoke this out of the abundance of her heart, was highly
provoked, and immediately replied, "Since you have so far
despised my old age as not to think me worthy the love that
your sisters express for me, you shall have from me the like
regard, and shall be excluded from any share with your
sisters in my kingdom. Notwithstanding, I do not say but
that since you are my daughter, I will marry you to some
foreigner, if fortune offers you any such husband; but will
never, I do assure you, make it my business to procure so
honourable a match for you as for your sisters; because,
though I have hitherto loved you more than them, you have
in requital thought me less worthy of your affection than
they." And, without further delay, after consultation with
his nobility, he bestowed his two other daughters upon the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
dukes of Cornwall and Albania, with half the island at
present, but after his death, the inheritance of the whole
monarchy of Britain.</p>

<p>It happened after this, that Aganippus, king of the
Franks, having heard of the fame of Cordeilla's beauty,
forthwith sent his ambassadors to the king to demand her in
marriage. The father, retaining yet his anger towards her,
made answer, "That he was very willing to bestow his
daughter, but without either money or territories; because
he had already given away his kingdom with all his treasure
to his eldest daughters, Gonorilla and Regau." When this
was told Aganippus, he, being very much in love with the
lady, sent again to king Leir, to tell him, "That he had money
and territories enough, as he possessed the third part
of Gaul, and desired no more than his daughter only, that
he might have heirs by her." At last the match was
concluded; Cordeilla was sent to Gaul, and married to Aganippus.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XII.</span>&mdash;<i>Leir, finding the ingratitude of his two eldest daughters,
betakes himself to his youngest, Cordeilla, in Gaul.</i></h3>


<p>A long time after this, when Leir came to be infirm through
old age, the two dukes, on whom he had bestowed Britain
with his two daughters, fostered an insurrection against him,
and deprived him of his kingdom, and of all regal authority,
which he had hitherto exercised with great power and glory.
At length, by mutual agreement, Maglaunus, duke of Albania,
one of his sons-in-law, was to allow him a maintenance
at his own house, together with sixty soldiers, who were to
be kept for state. After two years' stay with his son-in-law,
his daughter Gonorilla grudged the number of his men, who
began to upbraid the ministers of the court with their scanty
allowance; and, having spoken to her husband about it, she
gave orders that the numbers of her father's followers should
be reduced to thirty, and the rest discharged. The father,
resenting this treatment, left Maglaunus, and went to Henuinus,
duke of Cornwall, to whom he had married his daughter
Regau. Here he met with an honourable reception, but
before the year was at an end, a quarrel happened between
the two families, which raised Regau's indignation; so that
she commanded her father to discharge all his attendants but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
five, and to be contented with their service. This second
affliction was insupportable to him, and made him return
again to his former daughter, with hopes that the misery of
his condition might move in her some sentiments of filial
piety, and that he, with his family, might find a subsistence
with her. But she, not forgetting her resentment, swore by
the gods he should not stay with her, unless he would dismiss
his retinue, and be contented with the attendance of one
man; and with bitter reproaches she told him how ill his
desire of vain-glorious pomp suited his age and poverty.
When he found that she was by no means to be prevailed
upon, he was at last forced to comply, and, dismissing the
rest, to take up with one man only. But by this time he
began to reflect more sensibly with himself upon the grandeur
from which he had fallen, and the miserable state to
which he was now reduced, and to enter upon thoughts of going
beyond sea to his youngest daughter. Yet he doubted whether
he should be able to move her commiseration, because
(as was related above) he had treated her so unworthily.
However, disdaining to bear any longer such base usage, he
took ship for Gaul. In his passage he observed he had only
the third place given him among the princes that were with
him in the ship, at which, with deep sighs and tears, he burst
forth into the following complaint:&mdash;</p>

<p>"O irreversible decrees of the Fates, that never swerve
from your stated course! why did you ever advance me to
an unstable felicity, since the punishment of lost happiness
is greater than the sense of present misery? The remembrance
of the time when vast numbers of men obsequiously
attended me in the taking the cities and wasting the enemy's
countries, more deeply pierces my heart than the view of my
present calamity, which has exposed me to the derision of
those who were formerly prostrate at my feet. Oh! the
enmity of fortune! Shall I ever again see the day when
I may be able to reward those according to their deserts who
have forsaken me in my distress? How true was thy answer,
Cordeilla, when I asked thee concerning thy love to
me, 'As much as you have, so much is your value, and so
much do I love you.' While I had anything to give they
valued me, being friends, not to me, but to my gifts: they
loved me then, but they loved my gifts much more: when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
my gifts ceased, my friends vanished. But with what face
shall I presume to see you, my dearest daughter, since in my
anger I married you upon worse terms than your sisters,
who, after all the mighty favours they have received from
me, suffer me to be in banishment and poverty?"</p>

<p>As he was lamenting his condition in these and the like
expressions, he arrived at Karitia,<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> where his daughter was,
and waited before the city while he sent a messenger to inform
her of the misery he was fallen into, and to desire her
relief for a father who suffered both hunger and nakedness.
Cordeilla was startled at the news, and wept bitterly, and
with tears asked how many men her father had with him.
The messenger answered, he had none but one man, who had
been his armour-bearer, and was staying with him without
the town. Then she took what money she thought might be
sufficient, and gave it to the messenger, with orders to carry
her father to another city, and there give out that he was
sick, and to provide for him bathing, clothes, and all other
nourishment. She likewise gave orders that he should take
into his service forty men, well clothed and accoutred, and
that when all things were thus prepared he should notify his
arrival to king Aganippus and his daughter. The messenger
quickly returning, carried Leir to another city, and there
kept him concealed, till he had done every thing that Cordeilla
had commanded.</p>

and retinue, he sent word to Aganippus and his

assistance for recovering his dominions. Upon which they,
attended with their chief ministers of state and the nobility

thus reduced the whole kingdom to his power, he died the
third year after. Aganippus also died; and Cordeilla,
obtaining the government of the kingdom, buried her father

under the river Sore, in Leicester, and which had been
built originally under the ground to the honour of the god
Janus. And here all the workmen of the city, upon the

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XV.</span>&mdash;<i>Cordeilla, being imprisoned, kills herself. Margan, aspiring
to the whole kingdom, is killed by Cunedagius.</i></h3>


<p>After a peaceful possession of the government for five years,
Cordeilla began to meet with disturbances from the two sons
of her sisters, being both young men of great spirit, whereof
one, named Margan, was born to Maglaunus, and the other,
named Cunedagius, to Henuinus. These, after the death of
their fathers, succeeding them in their dukedoms, were incensed
to see Britain subject to a woman, and raised forces
in order to raise a rebellion against the queen; nor would
they desist from hostilities, till, after a general waste of her
countries, and several battles fought, they at last took her
and put her in prison, where for grief at the loss of her
kingdom she killed herself. After this they divided the
island between them; of which the part that reaches from
the north side of the Humber to Caithness, fell to Margan;
the other part from the same river westward was Cunedagius's
share. At the end of two years, some restless spirits
that took pleasure in the troubles of the nation, had access to
Margan, and inspired him with vain conceits, by representing
to him how mean and disgraceful it was for him not to govern
the whole island, which was his due by right of birth.
Stirred up with these and the like suggestions, he marched<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
with an army through Cunedagius's country, and began to
burn all before him. The war thus breaking out, he was
met by Cunedagius with all his forces, who attacked Margan,
killing no small number of his men, and, putting him to
flight, pursued him from one province to another, till at last
he killed him in a town of Kambria, which since his death
has been by the country people called Margan to this day.
After the victory, Cunedagius gained the monarchy of the
whole island, which he governed gloriously for three and
thirty years. At this time flourished the prophets Isaiah
and Hosea, and Rome was built upon the eleventh before
the Kalends of May by the two brothers, Romulus and
Remus.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XVI.</span>&mdash;<i>The successors of Cunedagius in the kingdom. Ferrex is
killed by his brother Porrex, in a dispute for the government.</i></h3>


<p>At last Cunedagius dying, was succeeded by his son Rivallo,
a fortunate youth, who diligently applied himself to the
affairs of the government. In his time it rained blood three
days together, and there fell vast swarms of flies, followed
by a great mortality among the people. After him succeeded
Gurgustius his son; after him Sisillius; after him Jago, the
nephew of Gurgustius; after him Kinmarcus the son of
Sisillius; after him Gorbogudo, who had two sons, Ferrex
and Porrex.</p>

<p>When their father grew old they began to quarrel about
the succession; but Porrex, who was the most ambitious of
the two, forms a design of killing his brother by treachery,
which the other discovering, escaped, and passed over into
Gaul. There he procured aid from Suard king of the
Franks, with which he returned and made war upon his
brother; coming to an engagement, Ferrex was killed and
all his forces cut to pieces. When their mother, whose name
was Widen, came to be informed of her son's death, she fell
into a great rage, and conceived a mortal hatred against the
survivor. For she had a greater affection for the deceased
than for him, so that nothing less would appease her indignation
for his death, than her revenging it upon her surviving
son. She took therefore her opportunity when he was
asleep, fell upon him, and with the assistance of her wo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>men
tore him to pieces. From that time a long civil
war oppressed the people, and the island became divided

another.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XVII.</span>&mdash;<i>Dunwallo Molmutius gains the sceptre of Britain, from
whom came the Molmutine laws.</i></h3>


<p>At length arose a youth of great spirit, named Dunwallo
Molmutius, who was the son of Cloten king of Cornwall,
and excelled all the kings of Britain in valour and gracefulness
of person. When his father was dead, he was no
sooner possessed of the government of that country, than he
made war against Ymner king of Loegria, and killed him in
battle. Hereupon Rudaucus king of Kambria, and Staterius
king of Albania, had a meeting, wherein they formed an
alliance together, and marched thence with their armies into
Dunwallo's country to destroy all before them. Dunwallo
met them with thirty thousand men, and gave them battle;
and when a great part of the day was spent in the fight, and
the victory yet dubious, he drew off six hundred of his
bravest men, and commanded them to put on the armour of
the enemies that were slain, as he himself also did, throwing
aside his own. Thus accoutred he marched up with speed
to the enemy's ranks, as if he was of their party, and approaching
the very place where Rudaucus and Staterius
were, commanded his men to fall upon them. In this
assault the two kings were killed and many others with
them. But Dunwallo Molmutius, fearing lest in this disguise
his own men might fall upon him, returned with his companions
to put off the enemy's armour, and take his own
again; and then encouraged them to renew the assault,
which they did with great vigour, and in a short time got
the victory, by dispersing and putting to flight the enemy.
From hence he marched into the enemy's countries, destroyed
their towns and cities, and reduced the people under his
obedience. When he had made an entire reduction of the
whole island, he prepared for himself a crown of gold, and
restored the kingdom to its ancient state. This prince
established what the Britons call the Molmutine laws, which
are famous among the English to this day. In these, among
other things, of which St. Gildas wrote a long time after, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
enacted, that the temples of the gods, as also cities, should
have the privilege of giving sanctuary and protection to any
fugitive or criminal, that should flee to them from his enemy.
He likewise enacted, that the ways leading to those temples
and cities, as also husbandman's ploughs, should be allowed
the same privilege. So that in his day, the murders and
cruelties committed by robbers were prevented, and every
body passed safe without any violence offered him. At last,
after a reign of forty years spent in these and other acts of
government, he died, and was buried in the city of Trinovantum,
near the temple of Concord, which he himself built,
when he first established his laws.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. I.</span>&mdash;<i>Brennius quarrels with Belinus his brother, and in order to
make war against him, marries the daughter of the king of the Norwegians.</i></h3>


<p>After this a violent quarrel happened between his two sons
Belinus and Brennius, who were both ambitious of succeeding
to the kingdom. The dispute was, which of them should
have the honour of wearing the crown. After a great many
sharp conflicts that passed between them, the friends of both
interposed, and brought them to agree on the division of the
kingdom on these terms: that Belinus should enjoy the
crown of the island, with the dominions of Loegria, Kambria,
and Cornwall, because, according to the Trojan constitution,
the right of inheritance would come to him as the
elder: and Brennius, as being the younger, should be subject
to his brother, and have for his share Northumberland,
which extended from the river Humber to Caithness. The
covenant therefore being confirmed upon these conditions,
they ruled the country for five years in peace and justice.
But such a state of prosperity could not long stand against
the endeavours of faction. For some lying incendiaries
gained access to Brennius and addressed him in this manner:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"What sluggish spirit has possessed you, that you can
bear subjection to Belinus, to whom by parentage and blood
you are equal; besides your experience in military affairs,
which you have gained in several engagements, when you so
often repulsed Cheulphus, general of the Morini, in his
invasions of our country, and drove him out of your
kingdom? Be no longer bound by a treaty which is a
reproach to you, but marry the daughter of Elsingius, king
of the Norwegians, that with his assistance you may recover
your lost dignity." The young man, inflamed with these and
the like specious suggestions, hearkened to them, and went
to Norway, where he married the king's daughter, as his
flatterers had advised him.</p>

<p>In the meantime his brother, informed of this, was violently
incensed, that without his leave he had presumed to act thus
against him. Whereupon he marched into Northumberland,
and possessed himself of that country and the cities in it,
which he garrisoned with his own men. Brennius, upon
notice given him of what his brother had done, prepared a
fleet to return to Britain with a great army of Norwegians.
But while he was under sail with a fair wind, he was overtaken
by Guichthlac, king of the Dacians,<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> who had pursued
him. This prince had been deeply in love with the young
lady that Brennius had married, and out of mere grief and
vexation for the loss of her, had prepared a fleet to pursue
Brennius with all expedition. In the sea-fight that happened
on this occasion, he had the fortune to take the very ship in
which the lady was, and brought her in among his companions.
But during the engagement, contrary winds arose
on a sudden, which brought on a storm, and dispersed the
ships upon different shores: so that the king of the Dacians,
being driven up and down, after a course of five days,
arrived with the lady at Northumberland, under dreadful
apprehensions, as not knowing upon what country this
unforeseen casualty had thrown him. When this came
to be known to the country people, they took them and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
carried them to Belinus, who was upon the sea-coast,
expecting the arrival of his brother. There were with
Guichthlac's ship three others, one of which had belonged
to Brennius's fleet. As soon as they had declared to the
king who they were, he was overjoyed at this happy

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. III.</span>&mdash;<i>Belinus in a battle routs Brennius, who thereupon flees to
Gaul.</i></h3>


<p>A few days after appeared Brennius, with his fleet again
got together, and arrived in Albania; and having received
information of the capture of his wife and others, and that
his brother had seized the kingdom of Northumberland in
his absence, he sent his ambassadors to him, to demand the
restitution of his wife and kingdom; and if he refused them,
to declare that he would destroy the whole island from sea to
sea, and kill his brother whenever he could come to an
engagement with him. On the other hand, Belinus absolutely
refused to comply with his demands, and assembling together
the whole power of the island, went into Albania to give him
battle. Brennius, upon advice that he had suffered a repulse,
and that his brother was upon his march against him,
advanced to meet him in a wood called Calaterium, in order
to attack him. When they were arrived on the field of
battle, each of them divided his men into several bodies, and
approaching one another, began the fight. A great part
of the day was spent in it, because on both sides the bravest
men were engaged; and much blood was shed by reason
of the fury with which they encountered each other. So
great was the slaughter, that the wounded fell in heaps, like
standing corn cut down by reapers. At last the Britons
prevailing, the Norwegians fled with their shattered troops
to their ships, but were pursued by Belinus, and killed
without mercy. Fifteen thousand men fell in the battle, nor
were there a thousand of the rest that escaped unhurt.
Brennius with much difficulty securing one ship, went as
fortune drove him to the coasts of Gaul; but the rest that
attended him, were forced to sculk up and down wherever
their misfortunes led them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. IV.</span>&mdash;<i>The king of Dacia, with Brennius's wife, is released out of
prison.</i></h3>


<p>Belinus, after this victory, called a council of his nobility,
to advise with them what he should do with the king of the
Dacians, who had sent a message to him out of prison, that
he would submit himself and the kingdom of Dacia to him,
and also pay a yearly tribute, if he might have leave to
depart with his mistress. He offered likewise to confirm this
covenant with an oath, and the giving of hostages. When
this proposal was laid before the nobility, they unanimously
gave their assent that Belinus should grant Guichthlac his
petition upon the terms offered. Accordingly he did grant
it, and Guichthlac was released from prison, and returned
with his mistress into Dacia.</p>

<p>Belinus now finding no body in the kingdom of Britain
able to make head against him, and being possessed of the
sovereignty of the whole island from sea to sea, confirmed
the laws his father had made, and gave command for a
settled execution of justice through his kingdom. But above
all things he ordered that cities, and the roads leading to
them, should enjoy the same privilege of peace that Dunwallo
had established. But there arose a controversy about the
roads, because the limits determining them were unknown.
The king, therefore, willing to clear the law of all
ambiguities, summoned all the workmen of the island
together, and commanded them to pave a causeway of
stone and mortar, which should run the whole length
of the island, from the sea of Cornwall, to the shores of
Caithness, and lead directly to the cities that lay along that
extent. He commanded another to be made over the breadth
of the kingdom, leading from Menevia, that was situated upon
the Demetian Sea, to Hamo's Port, and to pass through the
interjacent cities. Other two he also made obliquely through
the island, for a passage to the rest of the cities.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> He then

a law for the punishment of any injury committed upon them.
But if any one is curious to know all that he decreed concerning
them, let him read the Molmutine laws, which Gildas
the historian translated from British into Latin, and king
Alfred into English.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. VI.</span>&mdash;<i>Brennius, being made duke of the Allobroges, returns to
Britain to fight with his brother.</i></h3>


<p>While Belinus was thus reigning in peace and tranquillity,
his brother Brennius, who (as we said before) was driven
upon the coasts of Gaul, suffered great torments of mind.
For it was a great affliction to him to be banished from his
country, and to have no power of returning to retrieve his
loss. Being ignorant what course to take, he went among
the princes of Gaul, accompanied only with twelve men; and
when he had related his misfortune to every one of them, but
could procure assistance from none, he went at last to Seginus,
duke of the Allobroges, from whom he had an honourable
reception. During his stay here, he contracted such an
intimacy with the duke, that he became the greatest favourite
in the court. For in all affairs, both of peace and war, he
showed a great capacity, so that this prince loved him with
a paternal affection. He was besides of a graceful aspect,
tall and slender in stature, and expert in hunting and fowling,
as became his princely birth. So great was the friendship
between them, that the duke resolved to give him his only
daughter in marriage; and in case he himself should have
no male issue, he appointed him and his daughter to succeed
him in his dukedom of the Allobroges after his death. But
if he should yet have a son, then he promised his assistance
to advance him to the kingdom of Britain. Neither was
this the desire of the duke only, but of all the nobility of
his court, with whom he had very much ingratiated himself.
So then without farther delay the marriage was solemnized,
and the princes of the country paid their homage to him, as
the successor to the throne. Scarcely was the year at an
end before the duke died; and then Brennius took his opportunity
of engaging those princes of the country firmly in his
interest, whom before he had obliged with his friendship.
And this he did by bestowing generously upon them the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
duke's treasure, which had been hoarded up from the times
of his ancestors. But that which the Allobroges most
esteemed him for, was his sumptuous entertainments, and
keeping an open house for all.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. VII.</span>&mdash;<i>Belinus and Brennius being made friends by the mediation
of their mother, propose to subdue Gaul.</i></h3>


<p>When he had thus gained universal affection, he began to
consult with himself how he might take revenge upon his
brother Belinus. And when he had signified his intentions
concerning it to his subjects, they unanimously concurred
with him, and expressed their readiness to attend him to
whatever kingdom he pleased to conduct them. He therefore
soon raised a vast army, and having entered into a treaty
with the Gauls for a free passage through their country into
Britain, fitted out a fleet upon the coast of Neustria, in which
he set sail, and with a fair wind arrived at the island. Upon
hearing the rumour of his coming, his brother Belinus,
accompanied with the whole strength of the kingdom,
marched out to engage him. But when the two armies were
drawn out in order of battle, and just ready to begin the
attack, Conwenna, their mother, who was yet living, ran in
great haste through the ranks, impatient to see her son, whom
she had not seen for a long time. As soon, therefore, as she
had with trembling steps reached the place where he stood,
she threw her arms about his neck, and in transports kissed
him; then uncovering her bosom, she addressed herself to
him, in words interrupted with sighs, to this effect:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My son, remember these breasts which gave you suck,
and the womb wherein the Creator of all things formed you,
and from whence he brought you forth into the world, while
I endured the greatest anguish. By the pains then which I
suffered for you, I entreat you to hear my request: pardon
your brother, and moderate your anger. You ought not to
revenge yourself upon him who has done you no injury. As
for what you complain of,&mdash;that you were banished your
country by him,&mdash;if you duly consider the result, in strictness
can it be called injustice? He did not banish you to
make your condition worse, but forced you to quit a meaner
that you might attain a higher dignity. At first you enjoyed
only a part of a kingdom, and that in subjection to your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
brother. As soon as you lost that, you became his equal, by
gaining the kingdom of the Allobroges. What has he then done,
but raised you from a vassal to be a king? Consider farther,
that the difference between you began not through him, but
through yourself, who, with the assistance of the king of
Norway, raised an insurrection against him."</p>

<p>Moved by these representations of his mother, he obeyed
her with a composed mind, and putting off his helmet of his
own accord, went straight with her to his brother. Belinus,
seeing him approach with a peaceable countenance, threw
down his arms, and ran to embrace him; so that now, without
more ado, they again became friends; and disarming their
forces marched with them peaceably together to Trinovantum.
And here, after consultation what enterprise to undertake,
they prepared to conduct their confederate army into the
provinces of Gaul, and reduce that entire country to their
subjection.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. VIII.</span>&mdash;<i>Belinus and Brennius, after the conquest of Gaul, march
with their army to Rome.</i></h3>


<p>They accordingly passed over into Gaul the year after, and
began to lay waste that country. The news of which spreading
through those several nations, all the petty kings of the
Franks entered into a confederacy, and went out to fight
against them. But the victory falling to Belinus and Brennius,
the Franks fled with their broken forces; and the
Britons and Allobroges, elevated with their success, ceased
not to pursue them till they had taken their kings, and reduced
them to their power. Then fortifying the cities which
they had taken, in less than a year they brought the whole
kingdom into subjection. At last, after a reduction of all the
provinces, they marched with their whole army towards
Rome, and destroyed the cities and villages as they passed
through Italy.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. IX.</span>&mdash;<i>The Romans make a covenant with Brennius, but afterwards
break it, for which reason Rome is besieged and taken by Brennius.</i></h3>


<p>In those days the two consuls of Rome were Gabius and
Porsena,<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> to whose care the government of the country was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
committed. When they saw that no nation was able to
withstand the power of Belinus and Brennius, they came,
with the consent of the senate to them, to desire peace and
amity. They likewise offered large presents of gold and
silver, and to pay a yearly tribute, on condition that they
might be suffered to enjoy their own in peace. The two
kings therefore, taking hostages of them, yielded to their
petition, and drew back their forces into Germany. While
they were employing their arms in harassing that people,
the Romans repented of their agreement, and again taking
courage, went to assist the Germans. This step highly enraged
the kings against them, who concerted measures how
to carry on a war with both nations. For the greatness of
the Italian army was a terror to them. The result of their
council was, that Belinus with the Britons stayed in Germany,
to engage with the enemy there; while Brennius and
his army marched to Rome, to revenge on the Romans their
breach of treaty. As soon as the Italians perceived their
design, they quitted the Germans, and hastened to get before
Brennius, in his march to Rome. Belinus had intelligence
of it, and speedily marched with his army the same night,
and possessing himself of a valley through which the enemy
was to pass, lay hid there in expectation of their coming.
The next day the Italians came in full march to the place;
but when they saw the valley glittering with the enemy's
armour, they were struck with confusion, thinking Brennius
and the Galli Senones were there. At this favourable opportunity,
Belinus on a sudden rushed forth, and fell furiously
upon them: the Romans on the other hand, thus taken by
surprise, fled the field, since they neither were armed, nor
marched in any order. But Belinus gave them no quarter,
and was only prevented by night coming on, from making a
total destruction of them. With this victory he went straight
to Brennius, who had now besieged Rome three days. Then
joining their armies, they assaulted the city on every side,
and endeavoured to level the walls: and to strike a greater
terror into the besieged, erected gibbets before the gates of
the city, and threatened to hang up the hostages whom they
had given, unless they would surrender. But the Romans,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
nothing moved by the sufferings of their sons and relations,
continued inflexible, and resolute to defend themselves.
They therefore sometimes broke the force of the enemy's engines,
by other engines of their own, sometimes repulsed
them from the walls with showers of darts. This so incensed
the two brothers, that they commanded four and twenty of
their noblest hostages to be hanged in the sight of their
parents. The Romans, however, were only more hardened
at the spectacle, and having received a message from Gabius
and Porsena, their consuls, that they would come the next
day to their assistance, they resolved to march out of the city,
and give the enemy battle. Accordingly, just as they were
ranging their troops in order, the consuls appeared with their
re-assembled forces, marching up to the attack, and advancing
in a close body, fell on the Britons and Allobroges by
surprise, and being joined by the citizens that sallied forth,
killed no small number. The brothers, in great grief to see
such destruction made of their fellow soldiers, began to rally
their men, and breaking in upon the enemy several times,
forced them to retire. In the end, after the loss of many
thousands of brave men on both sides, the brothers gained
the day, and took the city, not however till Gabius was killed
and Porsena taken prisoner. This done, they divided among
their men all the hidden treasure of the city.</p>

<p>After this complete victory, Brennius stayed in Italy,
where he exercised unheard-of tyranny over the people.
But the rest of his actions and his death, seeing that they
are given in the Roman histories, I shall here pass over, to
avoid prolixity and meddling with what others have treated
of, which is foreign to my design. But Belinus returned to
Britain, which he governed during the remainder of his life
in peace; he repaired the cities that were falling to ruin, and
built many new ones. Among the rest he built one upon
the river Uske, near the sea of the Severn, which was for a
long time called Caer-osc, and was the metropolis of Dimetia;<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>
but after the invasion of the Romans it lost its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
first name, and was called the City of Legions, from the
Roman legions which used to take up their winter quarters
in it. He also made a gate of wonderful structure in Trinovantum,
upon the bank of the Thames, which the citizens
call after his name Billingsgate to this day. Over it he built
a prodigiously large tower, and under it a haven or quay for
ships. He was a strict observer of justice, and re-established
his father's laws everywhere throughout the kingdom. In
his days there was so great an abundance of riches among
the people, that no age before or after is said to have shown
the like. At last, when he had finished his days, his body
was burned, and the ashes put up in a golden urn, which
they placed at Trinovantum, with wonderful art, on the top
of the tower above-mentioned.</p>

<p>He was succeeded by Gurgiunt Brabtruc, his son, a sober
prudent prince, who followed the example of his father in all
his actions, and was a lover of peace and justice. When
some neighbouring provinces rebelled against him, inheriting
with them the bravery of his father, he repressed their insolence
in several fierce battles, and reduced them to a perfect
subjection. Among many other things it happened, that the
king of the Dacians, who paid tribute in his father's time,
refused not only tribute, but all manner of homage to him.
This he seriously resented, and passed over in a fleet to
Dacia, where he harassed the people with a most cruel war,
slew their king, and reduced the country to its former
dependence.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XII.</span>&mdash;<i>Ireland is given to be inhabited by the Barclenses, who had

<p>At that time, as he was returning home from his conquest
through the Orkney islands, he found thirty ships full of men
and women; and upon his inquiring of them the occasion of
their coming thither, their leader, named Partholoim, approached
him in a respectful and submissive manner, and
desired pardon and peace, telling him that he had been driven
out of Spain, and was sailing round those seas in quest of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
a habitation. He also desired some small part of Britain to
dwell in, that they might put an end to their tedious wanderings;
for it was now a year and a half since he had
been driven from his country, all of which time he and his
company had been out at sea. When Gurgiunt Brabtruc
understood that they came from Spain, and were called Barclenses,
he granted their petition, and sent men with them to
Ireland, which was then wholly uninhabited, and assigned it
to them. There they grew up and increased in number, and
have possessed that island to this very day. Gurgiunt
Brabtruc after this ended his days in peace, and was buried
in the City of Legions, which, after his father's death, he
ornamented with buildings and fortified with walls.</p>

his life, treating his subjects with mildness and affection.
He had for his wife a noble lady named Martia, accomplished
in all kinds of learning. Among many other admirable productions
of her wit, she was the author of what the Britons
call the Martian law. This also among other things king
Alfred translated, and called it in the Saxon tongue, <i>Pa
Marchitle Lage</i>. Upon the death of Guithelin, the government
of the kingdom remained in the hands of this queen
and her son Sisilius, who was then but seven years old,
and therefore unfit to take the government upon himself
alone.</p>

and judgment. But on her death, Sisilius took the crown
and government. After him reigned Kimarus his son, to
whom succeeded Danius his brother. After his death the
crown came to Morvidus, whom he had by his concubine
Tangustela. He would have been a prince of extraordinary
worth, had he not been addicted to immoderate cruelty, so
far that in his anger he spared nobody, if any weapon were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>

marched out against him, and fought him. In this
battle he alone did more than the greatest part of his army,
and after the victory, suffered none of the enemy to escape
alive. For he commanded them to be brought to him one
after another, that he might satisfy his cruelty in seeing
them killed; and when he grew tired of this, he gave orders
that they should be flayed alive and burned. During these
and other monstrous acts of cruelty, an accident happened
which put a period to his wickedness. There came from the
coasts of the Irish sea, a most cruel monster, that was continually
devouring the people upon the sea-coasts. As soon
as he heard of it, he ventured to go and encounter it alone;
when he had in vain spent all his darts upon it, the monster

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XVII.</span>&mdash;<i>Arthgallo is deposed by the Britons, and is succeeded by
Elidure, who restores him again his kingdom.</i></h3>


<p>After him Arthgallo, his brother, was dignified with the
crown, and in all his actions he was the very reverse of his
brother. He everywhere endeavoured to depress the nobility,
and advance the baser sort of the people. He plundered the
rich, and by those means amassed vast treasures. But the
nobility, disdaining to bear his tyranny any longer, made an
insurrection against him, and deposed him; and then advanced
Elidure, his brother, who was afterwards surnamed the pious,
on account of his commiseration to Arthgallo in distress. For
after five years' possession of the kingdom, as he happened to
be hunting in the wood Calaterium, he met his brother that
had been deposed. For he had travelled over several kingdoms,
to desire assistance for the recovery of his lost
dominions, but had procured none. And being now no
longer able to bear the poverty to which he was reduced,
he returned back to Britain, attended only by ten men, with
a design to repair to those who had been formerly his friends.
It was at this time, as he was passing through the wood, his
brother Elidure, who little expected it, got sight of him, and
forgetting all injuries, ran to him, and affectionately embraced
him. Now as he had long lamented his brother's affliction,
he carried him with him to the city Alclud, where he hid
him in his bed-chamber. After this, he feigned himself
sick, and sent messengers over the whole kingdom, to
signify to all his prime nobility that they should come to
visit him. Accordingly, when they were all met together at
the city where he lay, he gave orders that they should come
into his chamber one by one, softly, and without noise: his
pretence for which was, that their talk would be a disturbance
to his head, should they all crowd in together. Thus,
in obedience to his commands, and without the least suspicion
of any design, they entered his house one after another. But
Elidure had given charge to his servants, who were set ready
for the purpose, to take each of them as they entered, and cut
off their heads, unless they would again submit themselves to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
Arthgallo his brother. Thus did he with every one of them
apart, and compelled them, through fear, to be reconciled to
Arthgallo. At last the agreement being ratified, Elidure
conducted Arthgallo to York, where he took the crown from
his own head, and put it on that of his brother. From this
act of extraordinary affection to his brother, he obtained the
surname of Pious. Arthgallo after this reigned ten years,
and made amends for his former mal-administration, by
pursuing measures of an entirely opposite tendency, in
depressing the baser sort, and advancing men of good
birth; in suffering every one to enjoy his own, and exercising
strict justice towards all men. At last sickness

<p>Then Elidure was again advanced to the throne, and restored
to his former dignity. But while in his government he
followed the example of his eldest brother Gorbonian, in
performing all acts of grace; his two remaining brothers,
Vigenius and Peredure, raised an army, and made war
against him, in which they proved victorious; so that they
took him prisoner, and shut him up in the tower<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> at
Trinovantum, where they placed a guard over him. They
then divided the kingdom betwixt them; that part which is
from the river Humber westward falling to Vigenius's share,
and the remainder with all Albania to Peredure's. After
seven years Vigenius died, and so the whole kingdom came
to Peredure, who from that time governed the people with
generosity and mildness, so that he even excelled his other
brothers who had preceded him, nor was any mention now
made of Elidure. But irresistible fate at last removed him
suddenly, and so made way for Elidure's release from prison,
and advancement to the throne the third time; who finished
the course of his life in just and virtuous actions, and after
death left an example of piety to his successors.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XIX.</span>&mdash;<i>The names of Elidure's thirty-three successors.</i></h3>


<p>Elidure being dead, Gorbonian's son enjoyed the crown,
and imitated his uncle's wise and prudent government.
For he abhorred tyranny, and practised justice and mildness
towards the people, nor did he ever swerve from the rule of
equity. After him reigned Margan, the son of Arthgallo,
who, being instructed by the examples of his immediate
predecessors, held the government in peace. To him
succeeded Enniaunus, his brother, who took a contrary
course, and in the sixth year of his reign was deposed,
for having preferred a tyrannical to a just and legal administration.
In his room was placed his kinsman Idwallo, the
son of Vigenius, who, being admonished by Enniaunus's ill
success, became a strict observer of justice and equity. To
him succeeded Runno, the son of Peredure, whose successor
was Geruntius, the son of Elidure. After him reigned
Catellus, his son; after Catellus, Coillus; after Coillus,
Porrex; after Porrex, Cherin. This prince had three
sons, Fulgenius, Eldadus, and Andragius, who all reigned
one after another. Then succeeded Urianus, the son of
Andragius; after whom reigned in order, Eliud, Cledaucus,
Cletonus, Gurgintius, Merianus, Bleduno, Cap, Oenus,
Sisilius, Blegabred. This last prince, in singing and
playing upon musical instruments, excelled all the musicians
that had been before him, so that he seemed worthy of the
title of the God of Jesters. After him reigned Arthmail,
his brother; after Arthmail, Eldol; to whom succeeded in
order, Redion, Rederchius, Samuilpenissel, Pir, Capoir, and
Cligueillus the son of Capoir, a man prudent and mild in all
his actions, and who above all things made it his business to
exercise true justice among his people.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XX.</span>&mdash;<i>Heli's three sons; the first of whom, viz. Lud, gives name
to the city of London.</i></h3>


<p>Next to him succeeded his son Heli, who reigned forty
years. He had three sons, Lud, Cassibellaun,<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> and
Nennius; of whom Lud, being the eldest, succeeded to
the kingdom after his father's death. He became famous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
for the building of cities, and for rebuilding the walls of
Trinovantum, which he also surrounded with innumerable
towers. He likewise commanded the citizens to build
houses, and all other kinds of structures in it, so that no city
in all foreign countries to a great distance round could
show more beautiful palaces. He was withal a warlike
man, and very magnificent in his feasts and public entertainments.
And though he had many other cities, yet he
loved this above them all, and resided in it the greater
part of the year; for which reason it was afterwards
called Kaerlud, and by the corruption of the word, Caerlondon;
and again by change of languages, in process
of time, London; as also by foreigners who arrived here,
and reduced this country under their subjection, it was
called Londres. At last, when he was dead, his body
was buried by the gate which to this time is called in
the British tongue after his name, Parthlud,<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> and in the
Saxon, Ludesgata. He had two sons, Androgeus and
Tenuantius, who were incapable of governing on account
of their age: and therefore their uncle Cassibellaun was
preferred to the kingdom in their room. As soon as he
was crowned, he began to display his generosity and magnificence
to such a degree, that his fame reached to distant kingdoms;
which was the reason that the monarchy of the whole
kingdom came to be invested in him, and not in his
nephews. Notwithstanding Cassibellaun, from an impulse
of piety, would not suffer them to be without their share
in the kingdom, but assigned a large part of it to them.
For he bestowed the city of Trinovantum, with the dukedom
of Kent, on Androgeus; and the dukedom of Cornwall
on Tenuantius. But he himself, as possessing the crown,
had the sovereignty over them, and all the other princes
of the island.</p>

<h3>BOOK IV.</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. I.</span>&mdash;<i>Julius C&aelig;sar invades Britain.</i></h3>


<p>About this time it happened, (as is found in the Roman
histories,) that Julius C&aelig;sar, having subdued Gaul, came
to the shore of the Ruteni. And when from thence he
had got a prospect of the island of Britain, he inquired
of those about him what country it was, and what people
inhabited it. Then fixing his eyes upon the ocean, as
soon as he was informed of the name of the kingdom
and the people, he said:<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> "In truth we Romans and the
Britons have the same origin, since both are descended
from the Trojan race. Our first father, after the destruction
of Troy, was &AElig;neas; theirs, Brutus, whose
father was Sylvius, the son of Ascanius, the son of
&AElig;neas. But I am deceived, if they are not very much
degenerated from us, and know nothing of the art of war,
since they live separated by the ocean from the whole world.
They may be easily forced to become our tributaries, and
subjects to the Roman state. But before the Romans offer
to invade or assault them, we must send them word that
they pay tribute as other nations do, and submit themselves
to the senate; for fear we should violate the ancient nobility
of our father Priamus, by shedding the blood of our kinsmen."
All which he accordingly took care to signify in
writing to Cassibellaun; who in great indignation returned
him an answer in the following letter.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. II.</span>&mdash;<i>Cassibellaunus's letter to Julius C&aelig;sar.</i></h3>


<p>"Cassibellaun, king of the Britons, to Caius Julius C&aelig;sar.
We cannot but wonder, C&aelig;sar, at the avarice of the Roman
people, since their insatiable thirst for money cannot let us
alone, though the dangers of the ocean have placed us in a
manner out of the world; but they must have the presumption
to covet our substance, which we have hitherto enjoyed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
in quiet. Neither is this indeed sufficient: we must also
choose subjection and slavery to them, before the enjoyment
of our native liberty. Your demand, therefore, C&aelig;sar, is
scandalous, since the same vein of nobility flows from &AElig;neas
in both Britons and Romans, and one and the same chain of
consanguinity unites us: which ought to be a band of firm
union and friendship. It was that, which you should have
demanded of us, and not slavery: we have learned to admit
of the one, but never to bear the other. And so much have
we been accustomed to liberty, that we are perfectly ignorant
what it is to submit to slavery. And if even the gods themselves
should attempt to deprive us of our liberty, we would,
to the utmost of our power, resist them in defence of it.
Know then, C&aelig;sar, that we are ready to fight for that and
our kingdom, if, as you threaten, you shall attempt to invade
Britain."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. III.</span>&mdash;<i>C&aelig;sar is routed by Cassibellaun.</i></h3>


<p>On receiving this answer, C&aelig;sar made ready his fleet, and
waited for a fair wind to execute his threats against Cassibellaun.
As soon as the wind stood fair, he hoisted his sails,
and arrived with his army at the mouth of the river Thames.
The ships were now just come close to land, when Cassibellaun
with all his forces appeared on his march against them,
and coming to the town of Dorobellum, he consulted with his
nobility how to drive out the enemy. There was present
with him Belinus, general of his army, by whose counsel the
whole kingdom was governed. There were also his two
nephews, Androgeus, duke of Trinovantum, and Tenuantius,
duke of Cornwall, together with three inferior kings, Cridious,
king of Albania, Guerthaeth of Venedotia, and Britael of
Dimetia, who, as they had encouraged the rest to fight the
enemy, gave their advice to march directly to C&aelig;sar's camp,
and drive them out of the country before they could take any
city or town. For if he should possess himself of any fortified
places, they said it would be more difficult to force him
out, because he would then know whither to make a retreat
with his men. To this proposal they all agreed, and advanced
towards the shore where Julius C&aelig;sar had pitched
his camp. And now both armies drew out in order of battle,
and began the fight, wherein both bows and swords were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
employed. Immediately the wounded fell in heaps on each
side, and the ground was drenched with the blood of the
slain, as much as if it had been washed with the sudden
return of the tide. While the armies were thus engaged, it
happened that Nennius and Androgeus, with the citizens of
Canterbury and Trinovantum, whom they commanded, had
the fortune to meet with the troop in which C&aelig;sar himself
was present. And upon an assault made, the general's
cohort was very nearly routed by the Britons falling upon
them in a close body. During this action, fortune gave
Nennius an opportunity of encountering C&aelig;sar. Nennius
therefore boldly made up to him, and was in great joy that
he could but give so much as one blow to so great a man.
On the other hand, C&aelig;sar being aware of his design, stretched
out his shield to receive him, and with all his might struck
him upon the helmet with his drawn sword, which he lifted
up again with an intention to finish his first blow, and make
it mortal; but Nennius carefully prevented him with his
shield, upon which C&aelig;sar's sword glancing with great force
from the helmet, became so firmly fastened therein, that when
by the intervention of the troops they could no longer continue
the encounter, the general was not able to draw it out
again. Nennius, thus becoming master of C&aelig;sar's sword,
threw away his own, and pulling the other out, made haste
to employ it against the enemy. Whomsoever he struck
with it, he either cut off his head, or left him wounded without
hopes of recovery. While he was thus exerting himself,
he was met by Labienus, a tribune, whom he killed in the
very beginning of the encounter. At last, after the greatest
part of the day was spent, the Britons poured in so fast, and
made such vigorous efforts, that by the blessing of God they
obtained the victory, and C&aelig;sar, with his broken forces,
retired to his camp and fleet. The very same night, as soon
as he had got his men together again, he went on board his
fleet, rejoicing that he had the sea for his camp. And upon
his companions dissuading him from continuing the war any
longer, he acquiesced in their advice, and returned back to
Gaul.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. IV.</span>&mdash;<i>Nennius, the brother of Cassibellaun, being wounded in
battle by C&aelig;sar, dies.</i></h3>


<p>Cassibellaun, in joy for this triumph, returned solemn
thanks to God; and calling the companions of his victory
together, amply rewarded every one of them, according as
they had distinguished themselves. On the other hand, he
was very much oppressed with grief for his brother Nennius,
who lay mortally wounded, and at the very point of death.
For C&aelig;sar had wounded him in the encounter, and the blow
which he had given him proved incurable; so that fifteen
days after the battle he died, and was buried at Trinovantum,
by the North Gate. His funeral obsequies were performed
with regal pomp, and C&aelig;sar's sword put into the
tomb with him, which he had kept possession of, when struck
into his shield in the combat. The name of the sword
was <i>Crocea Mors</i> (Yellow Death), as being mortal to every
body that was wounded with it.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. V.</span>&mdash;<i>C&aelig;sar's inglorious return to Gaul.</i></h3>


<p>After this flight of C&aelig;sar, and his arrival on the Gallic
coast, the Gauls attempted to rebel and throw off his yoke.
For they thought he was so much weakened, that his forces
could be no longer a terror to them. Besides, a general
report was spread among them, that Cassibellaun was now
out at sea with a vast fleet to pursue him in his flight; on
which account the Gauls, growing still more bold, began to
think of driving him from their coasts. C&aelig;sar, aware of
their designs, was not willing to engage in a doubtful war
with a fierce people, but rather chose to go to all their first
nobility with open treasures, and reconcile them with presents.
To the common people he promised liberty, to the dispossessed
the restitution of their estates, and to the slaves their
freedom. Thus he that had insulted them before with the
fierceness of a lion, and plundered them of all, now, with
the mildness of a lamb, fawns on them with submissive
abject speeches, and is glad to restore all again. To these
acts of meanness he was forced to condescend till he had
pacified them, and was able to regain his lost power. In the
meantime not a day passed without his reflecting upon his
flight, and the victory of the Britons.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. VI.</span>&mdash;<i>Cassibellaun forms a stratagem for sinking C&aelig;sar's ships.</i></h3>


<p>After two years were expired, he prepared to cross the sea
again, and revenge himself on Cassibellaun, who having intelligence
of his design, everywhere fortified his cities, repaired
the ruined walls, and placed armed men at all the
ports. In the river Thames, on which C&aelig;sar intended to
sail up to Trinovantum, he caused iron and leaden stakes,
each as thick as a man's thigh, to be fixed under the surface
of the water, that C&aelig;sar's ships might founder. He then
assembled all the forces of the island, and took up his quarters
with them near the sea-coasts, in expectation of the
enemy's coming.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. VII.</span>&mdash;<i>C&aelig;sar a second time vanquished by the Britons.</i></h3>


<p>After he had furnished himself with all necessaries, the
Roman general embarked with a vast army, eager to revenge
himself on a people that had defeated him; in which he undoubtedly
would have succeeded, if he could but have brought
his fleet safe to land; but this he was not able to do. For
in sailing up the Thames to Trinovantum, the ships struck
against the stakes, which so endangered them all on a sudden,
that many thousands of the men were drowned, while the
ships being pierced sank into the river. C&aelig;sar, upon this,
employed all his force to shift his sails, and hastened to get
back again to land. And so those that remained, after a
narrow escape, went on shore with him. Cassibellaun, who
was present upon the bank, with joy observed the disaster of
the drowned, but grieved at the escape of the rest; and upon
his giving a signal to his men, made an attack upon the
Romans, who, notwithstanding the danger they had suffered
in the river, when landed, bravely withstood the Britons;
and having no other fence to trust to but their own courage,
they made no small slaughter; but yet suffered a greater loss
themselves, than that which they were able to give the enemy.
For their number was considerably diminished by their loss
in the river; whereas the Britons being hourly increased
with new recruits, were three times their number, and by
that advantage defeated them. C&aelig;sar, seeing he could no
longer maintain his ground, fled with a small body of men to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
his ships, and made the sea his safe retreat; and as the wind
stood fair, he hoisted his sails, and steered to the shore of
the Morini. From thence he repaired to a certain tower,
which he had built at a place called Odnea, before this second
expedition into Britain. For he durst not trust the fickleness
of the Gauls, who he feared would fall upon him a
second time, as we have said already they did before, after
the first flight he was forced to make before the Britons.
And on that account he had built this tower for a refuge to
himself, that he might be able to maintain his ground against
a rebellious people, if they should make insurrection against
him.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. VIII.</span>&mdash;<i>Evelinus kills Hirelglas. Androgeus desires C&aelig;sar's assistance
against Cassibellaun.</i></h3>


<p>Cassibellaun, elevated with joy for this second victory,
published a decree, to summon all the nobility of Britain with
their wives to Trinovantum, in order to perform solemn
sacrifices to their tutelary gods who had given them the
victory over so great a commander. Accordingly, they all
appeared, and prepared a variety of sacrifices, for which
there was a great slaughter of cattle. At this solemnity
they offered forty thousand cows, and a hundred thousand
sheep, and also fowls of several kinds without number, besides
thirty thousand wild beasts of several kinds. As soon
as they had performed these solemn honours to their gods,
they feasted themselves on the remainder, as was usual at
such sacrifices, and spent the rest of the day and night in
various plays and sports. Amidst these diversions, it happened
that two noble youths, whereof one was nephew to the
king, the other to duke Androgeus, wrestled together, and
afterwards had a dispute about the victory. The name of
the king's nephew was Hirelglas, the other's Evelinus. As
they were reproaching each other, Evelinus snatched up his
sword and cut off the head of his rival. This sudden disaster
put the whole court into a consternation, upon which the
king ordered Evelinus to be brought before him, that he
might be ready to undergo such punishment as the nobility
should determine, and that the death of Hirelglas might be
revenged upon him, if he were unjustly killed. Androgeus,
suspecting the king's intentions, made answer that he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
a court of his own, and that whatever should be alleged
against his own men, ought to be determined there. If,
therefore, he was resolved to demand justice of Evelinus, he
might have it at Trinovantum, according to ancient custom.
Cassibellaun, finding he could not attain his ends, threatened
Androgeus to destroy his country with fire and sword, if he
would not comply with his demands. But Androgeus, now
incensed, scorned all compliance with him. On the other
hand, Cassibellaun, in a great rage, hastened to make good
his threats, and ravage the country. This forced Androgeus
to make use of daily solicitations to the king, by means of
such as were related to him, or intimate with him, to divert
his rage. But when he found these methods ineffectual, he
began in earnest to consider how to oppose him. At last,
when all other hopes failed, he resolved to request assistance
from C&aelig;sar, and wrote a letter to him to this effect:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Androgeus, duke of Trinovantum, to Caius Julius C&aelig;sar,
instead of wishing death as formerly, now wishes health. I
repent that ever I acted against you, when you made war
against the king. Had I never been guilty of such exploits,
you would have vanquished Cassibellaun, who is so swollen
with pride since his victory, that he is endeavouring to drive
me out of his coasts, who procured him that triumph. Is
this a fit reward for my services? I have settled him in an
inheritance; and he endeavours to disinherit me. I have a
second time restored him to the kingdom: and he endeavours
to destroy me. All this have I done for him in fighting
against you. I call the gods to witness I have not deserved
his anger, unless I can be said to deserve it for refusing to
deliver up my nephew, whom he would have condemned to
die unjustly. Of which, that you may be better able to
judge, hear this account of the matter. It happened that for
joy of the victory we performed solemn honours to our
tutelary gods, in which after we had finished our sacrifices,
our youth began to divert themselves with sports. Among
the rest our two nephews, encouraged by the example of the
others, entered the lists; and when mine had got the better,
the other without any cause was incensed, and just going to
strike him: but he avoided the blow, and taking him by the
hand that held the sword, strove to wrest it from him. In
this struggle the king's nephew happened to fall upon the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
sword's point, and died upon the spot. When the king was
informed of it, he commanded me to deliver up the youth,
that he might be punished for murder. I refused do it;
whereupon he invaded my provinces with all his forces, and
has given me very great disturbance; flying, therefore, to
your clemency, I desire your assistance, that by you I may
be restored to my dignity, and by me you may gain possession
of Britain. Let no doubts or suspicion of treachery in
this matter detain you. Be influenced by the common motive
of mankind; let past enmities beget a desire of friendship;
and after defeat make you more eager for victory."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. IX.</span>&mdash;<i>Cassibellaun, being put to flight, and besieged by C&aelig;sar,
desires peace.</i></h3>


<p>C&aelig;sar, having read the letter, was advised by his friends
not to go into Britain upon a bare verbal invitation of the
duke, unless he would send such hostages as might be for
his security. Without delay, therefore, Androgeus sent his
son Sc&aelig;va with thirty young noblemen nearly related to
him. Upon delivery of the hostages, C&aelig;sar, relieved from
his suspicion, re-assembled his forces, and with a fair wind
arrived at the port of Rutupi. In the meantime Cassibellaun
had begun to besiege Trinovantum and ravage the country
towns; but finding that C&aelig;sar was arrived, he raised the
siege and hastened to meet him. As soon as he entered a
valley near Dorobernia,<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> he saw the Roman army preparing
their camp: for Androgeus had conducted them to this place,
for the convenience of making a sudden assault upon the city.
The Romans, seeing the Britons advancing towards them,
quickly flew to their arms, and ranged themselves in several
bodies. The Britons also put on their arms, and placed
themselves in their ranks. But Androgeus with five
thousand men lay hid in a wood hard by, to be ready to
assist C&aelig;sar, and spring forth on a sudden upon Cassibellaun
and his party. Both armies now approached to begin the
fight, some with bows and arrows, some with swords, so that
much blood was shed on both sides, and the wounded fell
down like leaves in autumn. While they were thus engaged,
Androgeus sallied forth from the wood, and fell upon the
rear of Cassibellaun's army, upon which the hopes of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
battle entirely depended. And now, what with the breach
which the Romans had made through them just before, what
with the furious irruption of their own countrymen, they
were no longer able to stand their ground, but were obliged
with their broken forces to quit the field. Near the place
stood a rocky mountain, on the top of which was a thick
hazel wood. Hither Cassibellaun fled with his men after he
found himself worsted; and having climbed up to the top of
the mountain, bravely defended himself and killed the
pursuing enemy. For the Roman forces with those of
Androgeus pursued him to disperse his flying troops, and
climbing up the mountain after them made many assaults,
but all to little purpose; for the rockiness of the mountain
and great height of its top was a defence to the Britons, and
the advantage of higher ground gave them an opportunity
of killing great numbers of the enemy. C&aelig;sar hereupon
besieged the mountain that whole night, which had now
overtaken them, and shut up all the avenues to it; intending
to reduce the king by famine, since he could not do it by
force of arms. Such was the wonderful valour of the
British nation in those times, that they were able to put
the conqueror of the world twice to flight; and being ready
to die for the defence of their country and liberty, they, even
though defeated, withstood him whom the whole world could
not withstand. Hence Lucan in their praise says of C&aelig;sar,</p>

<p style="margin-left:6em;">
"Territa qu&aelig;sitis ostendit terga Britannis."<br />
</p>

<p style="margin-left:6em;">
With pride he sought the Britons, but when found,<br />
Dreaded their force, and fled the hostile ground.<br />
</p>

<p>Two days were now passed, when Cassibellaun having
consumed all his provision, feared famine would oblige him
to surrender himself prisoner to C&aelig;sar. For this reason he
sent a message to Androgeus to make his peace with Julius,
lest the honour of the nation might suffer by his being taken
prisoner. He likewise represented to him, that he did not
deserve to be pursued to death for the annoyance which he
had given him. As soon as the messengers had told this to
Androgeus, he made answer:&mdash;"That prince deserves not
to be loved, who in war is mild as a lamb, but in peace cruel
as a lion. Ye gods of heaven and earth! Does my lord<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
then condescend to entreat me now, whom before he took
upon him to command? Does he desire to be reconciled and
make his submission to C&aelig;sar, of whom C&aelig;sar himself had
before desired peace? He ought therefore to have considered,
that he who was able to drive so great a commander
out of the kingdom, was able also to bring him back again.
I ought not to have been so unjustly treated, who had then
done him so much service, as well as now so much injury.
He must be mad who either injures or reproaches his fellow
soldiers by whom he defeats the enemy. The victory is not
the commander's, but theirs who lose their blood in fighting
for him. However, I will procure him peace if I can, for
the injury which he has done me is sufficiently revenged
upon him, since he sues for mercy to me."</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. X.</span>&mdash;<i>Androgeus's speech to C&aelig;sar.</i></h3>


<p>Androgeus after this went to C&aelig;sar, and after a respectful
salutation addressed him in this manner:&mdash;"You have
sufficiently revenged yourself upon Cassibellaun; and now
let clemency take place of vengeance. What more is there
to be done than that he make his submission and pay tribute
to the Roman state?" To this C&aelig;sar returned him no
answer: upon which Androgeus said again; "My whole
engagement with you, C&aelig;sar, was only to reduce Britain
under your power, by the submission of Cassibellaun.
Behold! Cassibellaun is now vanquished, and Britain by my
assistance become subject to you. What further service do
I owe you? God forbid that I should suffer my sovereign,
who sues to me for peace, and makes me satisfaction for the
injury which he has done me, to be in prison or in chains.
It is no easy matter to put Cassibellaun to death while I
have life; and if you do not comply with my demand, I
shall not be ashamed to give him my assistance." C&aelig;sar,
alarmed at these menaces of Androgeus, was forced to
comply, and entered into peace with Cassibellaun, on
condition that he should pay a yearly tribute of three
thousand pounds of silver. So then Julius and Cassibellaun
from this time became friends, and made presents to each
other. After this, C&aelig;sar wintered in Britain, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
following spring returned into Gaul.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> At length he
assembled all his forces, and marched towards Rome
against Pompey.</p>

he was the first who proceeded with a fleet to the Western Ocean, and
sailed over the Atlantic Sea, conducting an army to war; and being
desirous of possessing an island, for its size hardly believed in, and giving
occasion for much controversy to various writers, as if a name and a tale
had been invented of a place which never had been nor was yet in
existence, he advanced the dominion of the Romans beyond the limits
of the known world; and having twice sailed over to the island from the
opposite coast of Gaul, and having rather worsted his enemies in many
battles, than advantaged his own soldiers, for there was nothing worth
taking from men who had a bare subsistence and were poor, he terminated
the war not in the way he wished; but taking hostages from the king, and
appointing tributes, he departed from the island."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Plutarch.</span> This is the
language of a writer favourable to the reputation of C&aelig;sar, and may teach
us how worthless are the old British or rather Welsh legends in comparison
with the classic historians.
</p><p>
But the classic historians deal sometimes in fables. Witness the
following quotation from Poly&aelig;nus:
</p><p>
"C&aelig;sar attempting to pass a large river in Britain, Cassolaulus, king of
the Britons, obstructed him with many horsemen and chariots. C&aelig;sar had
in his train a very large elephant, an animal hitherto unseen by the Britons.
Having armed him with scales of iron, and put a large tower upon him, and
placed therein archers and slingers, he ordered them to enter the stream.
The Britons were amazed at beholding a beast till then unseen, and of an
extraordinary nature. As to the horses, what need to write of them! since
even among the Greeks, horses fly on seeing elephants even without harness,
but thus towered and armed, and casting darts and slinging, they could not
endure even to look upon the sight. The Britons therefore fled with their
horses and chariots. Thus the Romans passed the river without molestation,
having terrified the enemy by a single animal."</p></div>

Cornwall, and brother of Androgeus: for Androgeus was

wearing the crown, governed the kingdom with diligence.
He was a warlike man, and a strict observer of justice.

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XII.</span>&mdash;<i>Upon Guiderius's refusing to pay tribute to the Romans,
Claudius C&aelig;sar invades Britain.</i></h3>


<p>Kymbelinus, when he had governed Britain ten years, begat
two sons, the elder named Guiderius, the other Arviragus.
After his death the government fell to Guiderius. This
prince refused to pay tribute to the Romans; for which reason
Claudius, who was now emperor, marched against him. He
was attended in this expedition by the commander of his
army, who was called in the British tongue, Leuis Hamo, by
whose advice the following war was to be carried on. This
man, therefore, arriving at the city of Portcester, [Portchester,]
began to block up the gates with a wall, and denied the
citizens all liberty of passing out. For his design was either
to reduce them to subjection by famine, or kill them without
mercy.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XIII.</span>&mdash;<i>Leuis Hamo, a Roman, by wicked treachery kills Guiderius.</i></h3>


<p>Guiderius, upon the news of Claudius's coming, assembled
all the soldiery of the kingdom, and went to meet the Roman
army. In the battle that ensued, he began the assault with
great eagerness, and did more execution with his own sword
than the greater part of his army. Claudius was now on
the point of retreating to his ships, and the Romans very
nearly routed, when the crafty Hamo, throwing aside his own
armour, put on that of the Britons, and as a Briton fought
against his own men. Then he exhorted the Britons to a
vigorous assault, promising them a speedy victory. For he
had learned their language and manners, having been educated
among the British hostages at Rome. By these means
he approached by little and little to the king, and seizing a
favourable opportunity, stabbed him while under no apprehension
of danger, and then escaped through the enemy's
ranks to return to his men with the news of his detestable
exploit. But Arviragus, his brother, seeing him killed,
forthwith put off his own and put on his brother's habiliments,
and, as if he had been Guiderius himself, encouraged the
Britons to stand their ground. Accordingly, as they knew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
nothing of the king's disaster, they made a vigorous resistance,
fought courageously, and killed no small number of the
enemy. At last the Romans gave ground, and dividing
themselves into two bodies, basely quitted the field. C&aelig;sar
with one part, to secure himself, retired to his ships; but
Hamo fled to the woods, because he had not time to get
to the ships. Arviragus, therefore, thinking that Claudius
fled along with him, pursued him with all speed, and did not
leave off harassing him from place to place, till he overtook
him upon a part of the sea-coast, which, from the name of
Hamo, is now called Southampton. There was at the same
place a convenient haven for ships, and some merchant-ships
at anchor. And just as Hamo was attempting to get on
board them, Arviragus came upon him unawares, and forthwith
killed him. And ever since that time the haven has
been called Hamo's port.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XIV.</span>&mdash;<i>Arviragus, king of Britain, makes his submission to Claudius,
who with his assistance conquers the Orkney islands.</i></h3>


<p>In the meantime, Claudius, with his remaining forces,
assaulted the city above-mentioned, which was then called
Kaerperis, now Portcestre, and presently levelled the walls,
and having reduced the citizens to subjection, went after
Arviragus, who had entered Winchester. Afterwards he
besieged that city, and employed a variety of engines against
it. Arviragus, seeing himself in these straits, called his
troops together, and opened the gates, to march out and give
him battle. But just as he was ready to begin the attack,
Claudius, who feared the boldness of the king and the
bravery of the Britons, sent a message to him with a proposal
of peace; choosing rather to reduce them by wisdom and
policy, than run the hazard of a battle. To this purpose he
offered a reconciliation with him, and promised to give him
his daughter, if he would only acknowledge the kingdom of
Britain subject to the Roman state. The nobility hereupon
persuaded him to lay aside thoughts of war, and be content
with Claudius's promise; representing to him at the same time,
that it was no disgrace to be subject to the Romans, who enjoyed
the empire of the whole world. By these and many
other arguments he was prevailed upon to hearken to their
advice, and make his submission to C&aelig;sar. After which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
Claudius sent to Rome for his daughter, and then, with the
assistance of Arviragus, reduced the Orkney and the provincial
islands to his power.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_179_179" id="Footnote_179_179"></a><a href="#FNanchor_179_179"><span class="label">[179]</span></a> Claudius never was in Orkney; he spent only sixteen days altogether
in Britain. Of certain sacred isles in the neighbourhood of Britain, Plutarch
gives the following account, showing how little the Greeks knew of
Britain eighty years after the reign of Claudius:
</p><p>
"A short time before Callistratus celebrated the Pythian games, two holy
men from the opposite parts of the habitable earth came to us at Delphos,
Demetrius the grammarian from Britain, returning home to Tarsus, and
Cleombrotus the Laced&aelig;monian.... But Demetrius said, that there are
many desert islands scattered around Britain, some of which have the name
of being the islands of genii and heroes: that he had been sent by the
emperor, for the sake of describing and viewing them, to that which lay
nearest to the desert isles, and which had but few inhabitants; all of whom
were esteemed by the Britons sacred and inviolable. Very soon after his
arrival there was great turbulence in the air, and many portentous storms;
the winds became tempestuous, and fiery whirlwinds rushed forth. When
these ceased, the islanders said that the departure of some one of the
superior genii had taken place. For as a light when burning, say they, has
nothing disagreeable, but when extinguished is offensive to many; so likewise
lofty spirits afford an illumination benignant and mild, but their extinction
and destruction frequently, as at the present moment, excite winds
and storms, and often infect the atmosphere with pestilential evils. Moreover,
that there was one island there, wherein Saturn was confined by
Briareus in sleep: for that sleep had been devised for his bonds; and that
around him were many genii as his companions and attendants.
</p><p>
"Asclepiades asserts, that after their thirtieth year the Ethiopians, being
scorched by the sun, quickly grow old, in consequence of their bodies being
overheated; whereas in Britain they advance to an hundred and twenty
years, in consequence of the coldness of the place and their retaining
within themselves the vital heat: for the bodies of the Ethiopians are more
slender from their being relaxed by the sun, whereas the inhabitants of the
north are thick set in their persons, and on this account longer lived."</p></div>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XV.</span>&mdash;<i>Claudius gives his daughter Genuissa for a wife to Arviragus,
and returns to Rome.</i></h3>


<p>As soon as the winter was over, those that were sent for
Claudius's daughter returned with her, and presented her to
her father. The damsel's name was Genuissa, and so great
was her beauty, that it raised the admiration of all that saw
her. After her marriage with the king, she gained so great
an ascendant over his affections, that he in a manner valued
nothing but her alone: insomuch that he was desirous to
have the place honoured where the nuptials were solemnized,
and moved Claudius to build a city upon it, for a monument<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
to posterity of so great and happy a marriage. Claudius
consented to it, and commanded a city to be built, which after
his name is called Kaerglou, that is Gloucester, to this day,
and is situated on the confines of Dimetia and Loegria, upon
the banks of the Severn. But some say that it derived its
name from Duke Gloius, a son that was born to Claudius
there, and to whom, after the death of Arviragus, fell the
dukedom of Dimetia. The city being finished, and the island
now enjoying peace, Claudius returned to Rome, leaving to
Arviragus the government of the British islands. At the
same time the apostle Peter founded the Church of Antioch;
and afterwards coming to Rome, was bishop there, and sent
Mark, the evangelist, into Egypt to preach the gospel which
he had written.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XVI.</span>&mdash;<i>Arviragus revolting from the Romans, Vespasian is sent
into Britain.</i></h3>


<p>After the departure of Claudius, Arviragus began to show
his wisdom and courage, to rebuild cities and towns, and to
exercise so great authority over his own people, that he became
a terror to the kings of remote countries. But this so
elevated him with pride that he despised the Roman power,
disdained any longer subjection to the senate, and assumed
to himself the sole authority in every thing. Upon this news
Vespasian was sent by Claudius to procure a reconciliation
with Arviragus, or to reduce him to the subjection of the
Romans. When, therefore, Vespasian arrived at the haven
of Rutupi,<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> Arviragus met him, and prevented his entering
the port. For he brought so great an army along with him,
that the Romans, for fear of his falling upon them, durst not
come ashore. Vespasian upon this withdrew from that port,
and shifting his sails arrived at the shore of Totness. As
soon as he was landed, he marched directly to besiege Kaerpenhuelgoit,
now Exeter; and after lying before it seven
days, was overtaken by Arviragus and his army, who gave
him battle. That day great destruction was made in both
armies, but neither got the victory. The next morning, by
the mediation of queen Genuissa, the two leaders were made
friends, and sent their men over to Ireland. As soon as
winter was over, Vespasian returned to Rome, but Arvi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>ragus
continued still in Britain. Afterwards, when he grew
old, he began to show much respect to the senate, and to
govern his kingdom in peace and tranquillity. He confirmed
the old laws of his ancestors, and enacted some new ones,
and made very ample presents to all persons of merit. So
that his fame spread over all Europe, and he was both loved
and feared by the Romans, and became the subject of their
discourse more than any king in his time. Hence Juvenal
relates how a certain blind man, speaking of a turbot that
was taken, said:&mdash;</p>

<p>In war none was more fierce than he, in peace none more

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XVII.</span>&mdash;<i>Rodric, leader of the Picts, is vanquished by Marius.</i></h3>


<p>His son Marius, a man of admirable prudence and wisdom,
succeeded him in the kingdom. In his reign a certain king
of the Picts, named Rodric, came from Scythia with a great
fleet, and arrived in the north part of Britain, which is called
Albania, and began to ravage that country. Marius therefore
raising an army went in quest of him, and killed him in
battle, and gained the victory; for a monument of which he
set up a stone in the province, which from his name was
afterwards called Westmoreland, where there is an inscription
retaining his memory to this day. He gave the conquered
people that came with Rodric liberty to inhabit that part
of Albania which is called Caithness, that had been a long
time desert and uncultivated. And as they had no wives,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
they desired to have the daughters and kinswomen of the
Britons. But the Britons refused, disdaining to unite with
such a people. Having suffered a repulse here, they sailed
over into Ireland, and married the women of that country,
and by their offspring increased their number. But let thus
much suffice concerning them, since I do not propose to write
the history of this people, or of the Scots, who derived their
original from them and the Irish. Marius, after he had
settled the island in perfect peace, began to love the Roman
people, paying the tribute that was demanded of him; and
in imitation of his father's example practised justice, law,
peace, and every thing that was honourable in his kingdom.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XVIII.</span>&mdash;<i>Marius dying, is succeeded by Coillus.</i></h3>


<p>As soon as he had ended his days, his son Coillus took upon
him the government of the kingdom. He had been brought
up from his infancy at Rome, and having been taught the
Roman manners, had contracted a most strict amity with
them. He likewise paid them tribute, and declined making
them any opposition, because he saw the whole world subject
to them, and that no town or country was out of the limits
of their power. By paying therefore what was required
of him, he enjoyed his kingdom in peace: and no king ever
showed greater respect to his nobility, not only permitting
them to enjoy their own with quiet, but also binding them to
him by his continual bounty and munificence.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XIX.</span>&mdash;<i>Lucius is the first British king that embraces the Christian
faith, together with his people.</i></h3>


<p>Coillus had but one son, named Lucius, who, obtaining the
crown after his father's decease, imitated all his acts of goodness,
and seemed to his people to be no other than Coillus
himself revived. As he had made so good a beginning, he
was willing to make a better end: for which purpose he sent
letters to pope Eleutherius, desiring to be instructed by him
in the Christian religion. For the miracles which Christ's
disciples performed in several nations wrought a conviction
in his mind; so that being inflamed with an ardent love of
the true faith, he obtained the accomplishment of his pious
request. For that holy pope, upon receipt of this devout<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
petition, sent to him two most religious doctors, Faganus
and Duvanus, who, after they had preached concerning the
incarnation of the Word of God, administered baptism to
him, and made him a proselyte to the Christian faith.
Immediately upon this, people from all countries, assembling
together, followed the king's example, and being washed in
the same holy laver, were made partakers of the kingdom of
heaven. The holy doctors, after they had almost extinguished
paganism over the whole island, dedicated the temples, that
had been founded in honour of many gods, to the one only
God and his saints, and filled them with congregations
of Christians. There were then in Britain eight and twenty
flamens, as also three archflamens, to whose jurisdiction the
other judges and enthusiasts were subject. These also,
according to the apostolic command, they delivered from
idolatry, and where they were flamens made them bishops,
where archflamens, archbishops. The seats of the archflamens
were at the three noblest cities, viz. London,<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> York,
and the City of Legions, which its old walls and buildings
show to have been situated upon the river Uske in Glamorganshire.
To these three, now purified from superstition,
were made subject twenty-eight bishops, with their dioceses.
To the metropolitan of York were subject Deira and Albania,
which the great river Humber divides from Loegria. To the
metropolitan of London were subject Loegria and Cornwall.
These two provinces the Severn divides from Kambria or
Wales, which was subject to the City of Legions.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the glorious king Lucius highly rejoiced
at the great progress which the true faith and worship had
made in his kingdom, and permitted the possessions and
territories which formerly belonged to the temples of the
gods, to be converted to a better use, and appropriated to
Christian churches. And because a greater honour was due
to them than to the others, he made large additions of lands
and manor-houses, and all kinds of privileges to them.
Amidst these and other acts of his great piety, he departed
this life in the city of Gloucester, and was honourably buried
in the cathedral church, in the hundred and fifty-sixth year
after our Lord's incarnation. He had no issue to succeed
him, so that after his decease there arose a dissension
among the Britons, and the Roman power was much
weakened.</p>

Fulgenius.</i></h3>


<p>When this news was brought to Rome, the senate despatched
Severus, a senator, with two legions, to reduce the country
to subjection. As soon as he was arrived, he came to a
battle with the Britons, part of whom he obliged to submit
to him, and the other part which he could not subdue he
endeavoured to distress in several cruel engagements, and
forced them to fly beyond Deira into Albania. Notwithstanding
which they opposed him with all their might under the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
conduct of Fulgenius, and often made great slaughter both
of their own countrymen and of the Romans. For Fulgenius,
brought to his assistance all the people of the islands that he
could find, and so frequently gained the victory. The emperor,
not being able to resist the irruptions which he made,
commanded a wall to be built between Deira and Albania, to
hinder his excursions upon them; they accordingly made
one at the common charge from sea to sea, which for a long
time hindered the approach of the enemy. But Fulgenius,
when he was unable to make any longer resistance, made a
voyage into Scythia, to desire the assistance of the Picts
towards his restoration. And when he had got together all
the forces of that country, he returned with a great fleet into
Britain, and besieged York. Upon this news being spread
through the country, the greatest part of the Britons deserted
Severus, and went over to Fulgenius. However this did not
make Severus desist from his enterprise: but calling together
the Romans, and the rest of the Britons that adhered to him,
he marched to the siege, and fought with Fulgenius; but the
engagement proving very sharp, he was killed with many of
his followers: Fulgenius also was mortally wounded. Afterwards
Severus was buried at York, which city was taken by
his legions.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> He left two sons, Bassianus and Geta, whereof<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
Geta had a Roman for his mother, but Bassianus<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> a Briton.
Therefore upon the death of their father the Romans made
Geta king, favouring him on account of his being a Roman
by both his parents: but the Britons rejected him, and
advanced Bassianus, as being their countryman by his
mother's side. This proved the occasion of a battle between
the two brothers, in which Geta was killed; and so Bassianus
obtained the sovereignty.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p><div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_185_185" id="Footnote_185_185"></a><a href="#FNanchor_185_185"><span class="label">[185]</span></a> The following is an extract from the true account of the expedition of
Severus into Britain taken from Herodian:
</p><p>
"[Severus] received letters from the pr&aelig;fect of Britain relating that the
barbarians there were in a state of insurrection, overrunning the country,
driving off booty, and laying every thing waste; so that for the defence of
the island there was need either of greater force, or of the presence of the
emperor himself. Severus heard this with pleasure, by nature a lover of
glory, and anxious, after his victories in the east and north and his consequent
titles, to obtain a trophy from the Britons: moreover, willing to
withdraw his sons from Rome, that they might grow up in the discipline and
sobriety of a military life, far removed from the blandishments and luxury
prevalent in Rome, he orders an expedition against Britain, although now old
and labouring under an arthritic affection; but as to his mind, he was vigorous
beyond any youth. For the most part he performed the march carried
in a litter, nor did he ever continue long in one place. Having completed
the journey with his sons, and crossed over the sea more quickly than could
be described or expected, he advanced against the Britons, and having
drawn together his soldiers from all sides, and concentrated a vast force, he
prepared for the war.
</p><p>
"The Britons, much struck with the sudden arrival of the emperor, and
learning that such a mighty force was collected against them, sent ambassadors, sued for peace, and were willing to excuse their past transgressions.
But Severus, purposely seeking delay that he might not again return to
Rome without his object, and, moreover, desirous to obtain from Britain
a victory and a title, sent away their ambassadors without effecting
their purpose, and prepared all things for the contest. He more especially
endeavoured to render the marshy places stable by means of
causeways, that his soldiers, treading with safety, might easily pass them,
and, having firm footing, fight to advantage. For many parts of the British
country, being constantly flooded by the tides of the ocean, become marshy.
In these the natives are accustomed to swim and traverse about being immersed
as high as their waists: for going naked as to the greater part of
their bodies, they contemn the mud. Indeed they know not the use of
clothing, but encircle their loins and necks with iron; deeming this an
ornament and an evidence of opulence, in like manner as other barbarians
esteem gold. But they puncture their bodies with pictured forms of every
sort of animals; on which account they wear no clothing, lest they should
hide the figures on their body. They are a most warlike and sanguinary
race, carrying only a small shield and a spear, and a sword girded to their
naked bodies. Of a breast-plate or an helmet they know not the use,
esteeming them an impediment to their progress through the marshes;
from the vapours and exhalations of which the atmosphere in that country
always appears dense.
</p><p>
"Against such things, therefore, Severus prepared whatever could be
serviceable to the Roman army, but hurtful and detrimental to the designs
of the barbarians. And when every thing appeared to him sufficiently
arranged for the war, leaving his younger son, named Geta, in that part of
the island which was subjugated to the Romans, for the purpose of administering
justice and directing other civil matters of the government, giving him
as assessors the more aged of his friends; and taking Antoninus with himself,
he led the way against the barbarians. His army having passed beyond
the rivers and fortresses which defended the Roman territory, there
were frequent attacks and skirmishes and retreats on the side of the barbarians.
To these, indeed, flight was an easy matter, and they lay hidden
in the thickets and marshes through their local knowledge; all which things
being adverse to the Romans, served to protract the war."</p></div>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. III.</span>&mdash;<i>Carausius advanced to be king of Britain.</i></h3>


<p>At that time there was in Britain one Carausius, a young
man of mean birth, who, having given proof of his bravery
in many engagements, went to Rome, and solicited the
senate for leave to defend with a fleet the maritime coasts of
Britain, from the incursions of barbarians; which if they
would grant him, he promised to do more for the honour and
service of the commonwealth, than by delivering up to them
the kingdom of Britain. The senate, deluded by his specious
promises, granted him his request, and so, with his commission
sealed, he returned to Britain. Then by wicked practices
getting a fleet together, he enlisted into his service a
body of the bravest youths, and putting out to sea, sailed
round the whole kingdom, causing very great disturbance
among the people. In the meantime he invaded the adjacent
islands, where he destroyed all before him, countries, cities,
and towns, and plundered the inhabitants of all they had.
By this conduct he encouraged all manner of dissolute fellows
to flock to him in hope of plunder, and in a very short time
was attended by an army which no neighbouring prince was
able to oppose. This made him begin to swell with pride,
and to propose to the Britons, that they should make him
their king; for which consideration he promised to kill and
banish the Romans, and free the whole island from the invasions
of barbarous nations. Accordingly obtaining his request,
he fell upon Bassianus and killed him, and then took
upon him the government of the kingdom. For Bassianus
was betrayed by the Picts, whom Fulgenius his mother's
brother had brought with him into Britain, and who being
corrupted by the promises and presents of Carausius, instead
of assisting Bassianus, deserted him in the very battle, and
fell upon his men; so that the rest were put into a consternation,
and not knowing their friends from their foes, quickly
gave ground, and left the victory to Carausius. Then he, to
reward the Picts for this success, gave them a habitation
in Albania, where they continued afterwards mixed with
the Britons.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. IV.</span>&mdash;<i>Allectus kills Carausius, but is afterwards himself slain in
flight by Asclepiodotus.</i></h3>


<p>When the news of these proceedings of Carausius arrived
at Rome, the senate commissioned<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> Allectus, with three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
legions, to kill the tyrant, and restore the kingdom of Britain
to the Roman power. No sooner was he arrived, than he
fought with Carausius, killed him, and took upon himself the
government. After which he miserably oppressed the
Britons, for having deserted the commonwealth, and adhered
to Carausius. But the Britons, not enduring this, advanced
Asclepiodotus, duke of Cornwall, to be their king, and then
unanimously marched against Allectus, and challenged him
to battle. He was then at London, celebrating a feast to his
tutelary gods; but being informed of the coming of Asclepiodotus,
he quitted the sacrifice, and went out with all his
forces to meet him, and engaged with him in a sharp fight.
But Asclepiodotus had the advantage, and dispersed and put
to flight Allectus's troops, and in the pursuit killed many
thousands, as also king Allectus himself. After this victory,
Livius Gallus, the colleague of Allectus, assembled the rest
of the Romans, shut the gates of the city, and placed his men
in the towers and other fortifications, thinking by these
means either to make a stand against Asclepiodotus, or at
least to avoid imminent death. But Asclepiodotus seeing
this laid siege to the city, and sent word to all the dukes of
Britain, that he had killed Allectus with a great number of
his men, and was besieging Gallus and the rest of the Romans
in London; and therefore earnestly entreated them to hasten
to his assistance, representing to them withal, how easy it
was to extirpate the whole race of the Romans out of Britain,
provided they would all join their forces against the besieged.
At this summons came the Dimetians, Venedotians, Deirans,
Albanians, and all others of the British race. And as soon
as they appeared before the duke, he commanded vast numbers
of engines to be made, to beat down the walls of the
city. Accordingly every one readily executed his orders
with great bravery, and made a violent assault upon the city,
the walls of which were in a very short time battered down,
and a passage made into it. After these preparations, they
began a bloody assault upon the Romans, who, seeing their
fellow soldiers falling before them without intermission, persuaded
Gallus to offer a surrender on the terms of having
quarter granted them, and leave to depart: for they were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
now all killed except one legion, which still held out. Gallus
consented to the proposal, and accordingly surrendered himself
and his men to Asclepiodotus, who was disposed to give
them quarter; but he was prevented by a body of Venedotians,
who rushed upon them, and the same day cut off all
their heads upon a brook within the city, which from the
name of the commander was afterwards called in the British
tongue Nautgallim, and in the Saxon Gallembourne.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. V.</span>&mdash;<i>Asclepiodotus obtains the crown. Diocletian's massacre of the

<p>The Romans being thus defeated, Asclepiodotus,<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> with the
consent of the people, placed the crown upon his own head,
and governed the country in justice and peace ten years, and
curbed the insolence and outrages committed by plunderers
and robbers. In his days began the persecution of the emperor
Diocletian; and Christianity, which from the time of
king Lucius had continued fixed and undisturbed, was almost
abolished over the whole island. This was principally owing
to Maximianus Herculius, general of that tyrant's army, by
whose command all the churches were pulled down, and all
the copies of the Holy Scriptures that could be found,
were burned in the public markets. The priests also, with
the believers under their care, were put to death, and with
emulation pressed in crowds together for a speedy passage to
the joys of heaven, as their proper dwelling place. God
therefore magnified his goodness to us, forasmuch as he did,
in that time of persecution, of his mere grace, light up the
bright lamps of the holy martyrs, to prevent the spreading of
gross darkness over the people of Britain; whose sepulchres
and places of suffering might have been a means of inflaming
our minds with the greatest fervency of divine love, had not
the deplorable impiety of barbarians deprived us of them.
Among others of both sexes who continued firm in the army
of Christ, and suffered, were Alban of Verulam, and Julius
and Aaron, both of the City of Legions. Of these, Alban,
out of the fervour of his charity, when his confessor, Amphi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>balus,
was pursued by the persecutors, and just ready to be
apprehended, first hid him in his house, and then offered
himself to die for him; imitating in this Christ himself, who
laid down his life for his sheep. The other two, after being
torn limb from limb, in a manner unheard of, received the
crown of martyrdom, and were elevated up to the gates of
the heavenly Jerusalem.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. VI.</span>&mdash;<i>An insurrection against Asclepiodotus, by Coel, whose

<p>In the meantime Coel,<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> duke of Kaercolvin or Colchester,
made an insurrection against king Asclepiodotus, and in a
pitched battle killed him, and took possession of his crown.
The senate, hearing this, rejoiced at the king's death, who
had given such disturbance to the Roman power: and reflecting
on the damage which they had sustained by the loss of
this kingdom, they sent Constantius the senator, a man of
prudence and courage, who had reduced Spain under their
subjection, and who was above all the rest industrious to
promote the good of the commonwealth. Coel, having information
of his coming, was afraid to engage him in battle,
on account of a report, that no king was able to stand before
him. Therefore, as soon as Constantius was arrived at the
island, Coel sent ambassadors to him with offers of peace and
submission, on condition that he should enjoy the kingdom
of Britain, and pay no more than the usual tribute to the
Roman state. Constantius consented to this proposal, and so,
upon their giving hostages, peace was confirmed between
them. The month after Coel was seized with a very great
sickness, of which he died within eight days. After his
decease, Constantius himself was crowned, and married the
daughter of Coel, whose name was Helena. She surpassed
all the ladies of the country in beauty, as she did all others
of the time in her skill in music and the liberal arts. Her
father had no other issue to succeed him on the throne; for
which reason he was very careful about her education, that
she might be better qualified to govern the kingdom. Constantius,
therefore, having made her partner of his bed, had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
a son by her called Constantine.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> After eleven years were
expired, he died at York, and bestowed the kingdom upon
his son, who, within a few years after he was raised to this
dignity, began to give proofs of heroic virtue, undaunted
courage, and strict observance of justice towards his people.
He put a stop to the depredations of robbers, suppressed the
insolence of tyrants, and endeavoured everywhere to restore
peace.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. VIII.</span>&mdash;<i>Constantine, having reduced Rome, obtains the empire of
the world. Octavius, duke of the Wisseans, is put to flight by Trahern.</i></h3>


<p>Constantine, moved with these and the like speeches, made
an expedition to Rome, and reduced it under his power, and
afterwards obtained the empire of the whole world. In this
expedition he carried along with him three uncles of Helena,
viz. Leolin, Trahern, and Marius, and advanced them to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
degree of senators. In the meantime Octavius, duke of the
Wisseans, rebelled against the Roman proconsuls, to whom
the government of the island had been committed, and having
killed them, took possession of the throne. Constantine, upon
information of this, sent Trahern, the uncle of Helena, with
three legions to reduce the island. Trahern came to shore
near the city, which in the British tongue is called Kaerperis,
and having assailed it, took it in two days. This news
spreading over the whole country, king Octavius assembled
all the forces of the land, and went to meet him not far from
Winchester, in a field called in the British tongue Maisuriam,
where he engaged with him in battle, and routed him.
Trahern, upon this loss, betook himself with his broken
forces to his ships, and in them made a voyage to Albania,
in the provinces of which he made great destruction. When
Octavius received intelligence of this, he followed him with
his forces, and encountered him in Westmoreland, but fled,
having lost the victory. On the other hand, Trahern, when
he found the day was his own, pursued Octavius, nor ever
suffered him to be at rest till he had dispossessed him both
of his cities and crown. Octavius, in great grief for the loss
of his kingdom, went with his fleet to Norway, to obtain
assistance from king Gombert. In the meantime he had
given orders to his most intimate adherents to watch
carefully all opportunities of killing Trahern, which
accordingly was not long after done by the magistrate
of a certain privileged town, who had a more than
ordinary love for him. For as Trahern was one day
upon a journey from London, he lay hid with a hundred
men in the vale of a wood, through which he was to pass,
and there fell upon him unawares, and killed him in the
midst of his men. This news being brought to Octavius, he
returned back to Britain, where he dispersed the Romans,
and recovered the throne. In a short time after this, he
arrived to such greatness and wealth that he feared nobody,
and possessed the kingdom until the reign of Gratian and
Valentinian.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. IX.</span>&mdash;<i>Maximian is desired for a king of Britain.</i></h3>


<p>At last, in his old age, being willing to settle the government,
he asked his council which of his family they desired<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
to have for their king after his decease. For he had no son,
and only one daughter, to whom he could leave the crown.
Some, therefore, advised him to bestow his daughter with
the kingdom upon some noble Roman, to the end that they
might enjoy a firmer peace. Others were of opinion that
Conan Meriadoc, his nephew, ought to be preferred to the
throne, and the daughter married to some prince of another
kingdom with a dowry in money. While these things were
in agitation among them, there came Caradoc, duke of
Cornwall, and gave his advice to invite over Maximian<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> the
senator, and to bestow the lady with the kingdom upon him,
which would be a means of securing to them a lasting peace.
For his father Leolin, the uncle of Constantine, whom we
mentioned before, was a Briton, but by his mother and place
of birth he was a Roman, and by both parents he was
descended of royal blood. And there was a sure prospect
of a firm and secure peace under him, on account of the right
which he had to Britain by his descent from the emperors,
and also from the British blood. But the duke of Cornwall,
by delivering this advice, brought upon himself the displeasure
of Conan, the king's nephew, who was very
ambitious of succeeding to the kingdom, and put the
whole court into confusion about it. However, Caradoc,
being unwilling to recede from his proposal, sent his son
Mauricius to Rome to acquaint Maximian with what had
passed. Mauricius was a person of large and well-proportioned
stature, as well as great courage and boldness, and
could not bear to have his judgment contradicted without a
recourse to arms and duelling. On presenting himself before
Maximian, he met with a reception suitable to his quality,
and had the greatest honours paid him of any that were
about him. There happened to be at that time a great
contest between Maximian and the two emperors, Gratian
and Valentinian, on account of his being refused the third
part of the empire, which he demanded. When, therefore,
Mauricius saw Maximian ill-treated by the emperors, he took
occasion from thence to address him in this manner: "Why
need you, Maximian, stand in fear of Gratian, when you have
so fair an opportunity of wresting the empire from him?
Come with me into Britain, and you shall take possession<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
of that crown. For king Octavius, being now grown old
and infirm, desires nothing more than to find some such
proper person, to bestow his kingdom and daughter upon.
He has no male issue, and therefore has asked the advice
of his nobility, to whom he should marry his daughter with
the kingdom; and they to his satisfaction have past a decree,
that the kingdom and lady be given to you, and have sent
me to acquaint you with it. So that if you go with me, and
accomplish this affair, you may with the treasure and forces
of Britain be able to return back to Rome, drive out the
emperors, and gain the empire to yourself. For in this
manner did your kinsman Constantius, and several others
of our kings who raised themselves to the empire."</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. X.</span>&mdash;<i>Maximian, coming into Britain, artfully declines fighting
with Conan.</i></h3>


<p>Maximian was pleased with the offer, and took his journey
to Britain; but in his way subdued the cities of the Franks,
by which he amassed a great treasure of gold and silver, and
raised men for his service in all parts. Afterwards he set
sail with a fair wind, and arrived at Hamo's Port; the news
of which struck the king with fear and astonishment, who
took this to be a hostile invasion. Whereupon he called to
him his nephew Conan, and commanded him to raise all the
forces of the kingdom, and go to meet the enemy. Conan,
having made the necessary preparations, marched accordingly
to Hamo's Port, where Maximian had pitched his tents;
who, upon seeing the approach of so numerous an army,
was under the greatest perplexities what course to take.
For as he was attended with a smaller body of men, and had
no hopes of being entertained peaceably, he dreaded both the
number and courage of the enemy. Under these difficulties
he called a council of the oldest men, together with Mauricius,
to ask their advice what was to be done at this critical juncture.
"It is not for us," said Mauricius, "to hazard a battle
with such a numerous and powerful army: neither was the
reduction of Britain by arms the end of our coming. Our
business must be to desire peace and a hospitable treatment,
till we can learn the king's mind. Let us say that we are sent
by the emperors upon an embassy to Octavius, and let us
with artful speeches pacify the people." When all had shown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
themselves pleased with this advice, he took with him twelve
aged men with grey hairs, eminent beyond the rest for their
quality and wisdom, and bearing olive-branches in their right
hands, and went to meet Conan. The Britons, seeing they
were men of a venerable age, and that they bore olive-branches
as a token of peace, rose up before them in a
respectful manner, and opened a way for their free access
to their commander. Then presenting themselves before
Conan Meriadoc, they saluted him in the name of the
emperors and the senate, and told him, that Maximian
was sent to Octavius upon an embassy from Gratian and
Valentinian. Conan made answer: "Why is he then
attended with so great a multitude? This does not look
like the appearance of ambassadors, but the invasion of
enemies." To which Mauricius replied: "It did not become
so great a man to appear abroad in a mean figure, or without
soldiers for his guard; especially considering, that by reason
of the Roman power, and the actions of his ancestors, he is
become obnoxious to many kings. If he had but a small
retinue, he might have been killed by the enemies of the
commonwealth. He is come in peace, and it is peace which
he desires. For, from the time of our arrival, our behaviour
has been such as to give no offence to any body. We have
bought necessaries at our own expenses, as peaceable people
do, and have taken nothing from any by violence." While
Conan was in suspense, whether to give them peace, or
begin the battle, Caradoc, duke of Cornwall, with others
of the nobility, came to him, and dissuaded him from proceeding
in the war after this representation; whereupon,
though much against his will, he laid down his arms, and
granted them peace. Then he conducted Maximian to
London, where he gave the king an account of the whole
proceeding.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XI.</span>&mdash;<i>The kingdom of Britain is bestowed on Maximian.</i></h3>


<p>Caradoc, after this, taking along with him his son Mauricius,
commanded everybody to withdraw from the king's
presence, and then addressed him in these words: "Behold,
that which your more faithful and loyal subjects have long
wished for, is now by the good providence of God brought
about. You commanded your nobility to give their advice,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
how to dispose of your daughter and kingdom, as being willing
to hold the government no longer on account of your
great age. Some, therefore, were for having the kingdom
delivered up to Conan your nephew, and a suitable match
procured for your daughter elsewhere; as fearing the ruin
of our people, if any prince that is a stranger to our language
should be set over us. Others were for granting the
kingdom to your daughter and some nobleman of our own
country, who should succeed you after your death. But the
greater number recommended some person descended of the
family of the emperors, on whom you should bestow your
daughter and crown. For they promised themselves a firm
and lasting peace, as the consequence of such a marriage,
since they would be under the protection of the Roman
state. See then! God has vouchsafed to bring to you a
young man, who is both a Roman, and also of the royal
family of Britain; and to whom, if you follow my advice,
you will not delay to marry your daughter. And indeed,
should you refuse him, what right could you plead to the
crown of Britain against him? For he is the cousin of Constantine,
and the nephew of king Coel, whose daughter
Helena possessed the crown by an undeniable hereditary
right." When Caradoc had represented these things to him,
Octavius acquiesced, and with the general consent of his
people bestowed the kingdom and his daughter upon him.
Conan Meriadoc, finding how things went, was beyond expression
incensed, and, retiring into Albania, used all his
interest to raise an army, that he might give disturbance to
Maximian. And when he had got a great body of men
together, he passed the Humber, and wasted the provinces
on each side of it. At the news whereof, Maximian
hastened to assemble his forces against him, and then gave
him battle, and returned with victory. But this proved no
decisive blow to Conan, who with his re-assembled troops
still continued to ravage the provinces, and provoked Maximian
to return again and renew the war, in which he had
various success, being sometimes victorious, sometimes defeated.
At last, after great damages done on both sides,
they were brought by the mediation of friends to a reconciliation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XII.</span>&mdash;<i>Maximian overthrows the Armoricans: his speech to
Conan.</i></h3>


<p>Five years after this, Maximian, proud of the vast treasures
that daily flowed in upon him, fitted out a great fleet, and
assembled together all the forces in Britain. For this kingdom
was now not sufficient for him; he was ambitious of
adding Gaul also to it. With this view he set sail, and
arrived first at the kingdom of Armorica, now called Bretagne,
and began hostilities upon the Gallic people that
inhabited it. But the Gauls, under the command of Imbaltus,
met him, and engaged him in battle, in which the
greater part being in danger, they were forced to fly, and
leave Imbaltus with fifteen thousand men killed, all of them
Armoricans. This severe overthrow was matter of the
greatest joy to Maximian, who knew the reduction of that
country would be very easy, after the loss of so many men.
Upon this occasion he called Conan aside from the army,
and smiling said:&mdash;"See, we have already conquered one of
the best kingdoms in Gaul: we may now have hopes of
gaining all the rest. Let us make haste to take the cities
and towns, before the rumour of their danger spread to the
remoter parts of Gaul, and raise all the people up in arms.
For if we can but get possession of this kingdom, I make no
doubt of reducing all Gaul under our power. Be not therefore
concerned that you have yielded up the island of
Britain to me, notwithstanding the hopes you once had of
succeeding to it; because whatever you have lost in it, I
will restore to you in this country. For my design is to
advance you to the throne of this kingdom; and this shall
be another Britain, which we will people with our own
countrymen, and drive out the old inhabitants. The land is
fruitful in corn, the rivers abound with fish, the woods
afford a beautiful prospect, and the forests are everywhere
pleasant; nor is there in my opinion anywhere a more delightful
country." Upon this, Conan, with a submissive
bow, gave him his thanks, and promised to continue loyal to
him as long as he lived.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XIII.</span>&mdash;<i>Redonum taken by Maximian.</i></h3>


<p>After this they marched with their forces to Redonum,<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>
and took it the same day. For the citizens, hearing of the
bravery of the Britons, and what slaughter they had made,
fled away with haste, leaving their wives and children
behind them. And the rest of the cities and towns soon
followed their example; so that there was an easy entrance
into them for the Britons, who wherever they entered killed
all they found left of the male sex, and spared only the
women. At last, when they had wholly extirpated the
inhabitants of all those provinces, they garrisoned the cities
and towns with British soldiers, and made fortifications in
several places. The fame of Maximian's exploits spreading
over the rest of the provinces of Gaul, all their dukes and
princes were in a dreadful consternation, and had no other
hopes left but in their prayers to their gods. Maximian,
finding that he had struck terror into them, began to think
of still bolder attempts, and by profusely distributing presents,
augmented his army. For all persons that he knew
to be eager for plunder, he enlisted into his service, and
by plentifully bestowing his money and other valuable things
among them, kept them firm to his interest.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XIV.</span>&mdash;<i>Maximian, after the conquest of Gaul and Germany, makes
Triers the seat of his empire.</i></h3>


<p>By these means he raised such a numerous army, as he
thought would be sufficient for the conquest of all Gaul.
Notwithstanding which he suspended his arms for a time,
till he had settled the kingdom which he had taken, and
peopled it with Britons. To this end he published a decree,
for the assembling together of a hundred thousand of the
common people of Britain, who were to come over to settle
in the country; besides thirty thousand soldiers, to defend
them from hostile attack. As soon as the people were
arrived according to his orders, he distributed them through
all the countries of Armorica, and made another Britain of
it, and then bestowed it on Conan Meriadoc. But he himself,
with the rest of his fellow soldiers, marched into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
further part of Gaul, which, after many bloody battles, he
subdued, as he did also all Germany, being everywhere
victorious. But the seat of his empire he made at Triers,
and fell so furiously upon the two emperors, Gratian and
Valentinian, that he killed the one, and forced the other to
flee from Rome.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XV.</span>&mdash;<i>A fight between the Aquitanians and Conan.</i></h3>


<p>In the meantime, the Gauls and Aquitanians gave disturbance
to Conan and the Armorican Britons, and harassed
them with their frequent incursions; but he as often defeated
them, and bravely defended the country committed to him.
After he had entirely vanquished them, he had a mind to
bestow wives on his fellow soldiers, by whom they might
have issue to keep perpetual possession of the country; and
to avoid all mixture with the Gauls, he sent over to the
island of Britain for wives for them. In order to accomplish
this, messengers were sent to recommend the management
of this affair to Dianotus, king of Cornwall, who had
succeeded his brother Caradoc in that kingdom. He was a
very noble and powerful prince, and to him Maximian had
committed the government, while he was employed in affairs
abroad. He had also a daughter of wonderful beauty,
named Ursula, with whom Conan was most passionately
in love.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XVI.</span>&mdash;<i>Guanius and Melga murder eleven thousand virgins. Maximian
is killed at Rome.</i></h3>


<p>Dianotus, upon this message sent him by Conan, was very
ready to execute his orders, and summoned together the
daughters of the nobility from all provinces, to the number
of eleven thousand; but of the meaner sort, sixty thousand;
and commanded them all to appear together in the city of
London. He likewise ordered ships to be brought from all
shores, for their transportation to their future husbands.
And though in so great a multitude many were pleased with
this order, yet it was displeasing to the greater part, who
had a greater affection for their relations and native country.
Nor, perhaps, were there wanting some who, preferring
virginity to the married state, would have rather lost their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
lives in any country, than enjoyed the greatest plenty in
wedlock. In short, most of them had views and wishes different
from one another, had they been left to their own
liberty. But now the ships being ready, they went on
board, and sailing down the Thames, made towards the sea.
At last, as they were steering towards the Armorican coast,
contrary winds arose and dispersed the whole fleet. In this
storm the greater part of the ships foundered; but the
women that escaped the danger of the sea, were driven upon
strange islands, and by a barbarous people either murdered
or made slaves. For they happened to fall into the hands of
the cruel army of Guanius and Melga, who, by the command
of Gratian,<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> were making terrible destruction in Germany,
and the nations on the sea-coast. Guanius was king
of the Huns, and Melga of the Picts, whom Gratian had
engaged in his party, and had sent him into Germany to
harass those of Maximian's party along the sea-coasts.
While they were thus exercising their barbarous rage, they
happened to light upon these virgins, who had been driven
on those parts, and were so inflamed with their beauty, that
they courted them to their brutish embraces; which, when
the women would not submit to, the Ambrons fell upon
them, and without remorse murdered the greatest part of
them. This done, the two wicked leaders of the Picts and
Huns, Guanius and Melga, being the partizans of Gratian
and Valentinian, when they had learned that the island of
Britain was drained of all its soldiers, made a speedy voyage
towards it; and, taking into their assistance the people of
the adjacent islands, arrived in Albania. Then joining in a
body, they invaded the kingdom, which was left without
either government or defence, and made miserable destruction
among the common people. For Maximian, as we have
already related, had carried away with him all the warlike
youth that could be found, and had left behind him only the
husbandmen, who had neither sense nor arms, for the defence
of their country. Guanius and Melga, finding that they
were not able to make the least opposition, began to domineer
most insolently, and to lay waste their cities and countries,
as if they had only been pens of sheep. The news of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
grievous calamity, coming to Maximian, he sent away Gratian
Municeps,<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> with two legions, to their assistance; who,
as soon as they arrived, fought with the enemy, and after a
most bloody victory over them, forced them to fly over into
Ireland. In the meantime, Maximian was killed at Rome
by Gratian's friends;<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> and the Britons whom he had carried
with him were also slain or dispersed. Those of them that
could escape, went to their countrymen in Armorica, which
was now called the other Britain.</p>

<h3>BOOK VI.</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. I.</span>&mdash;<i>Gratian, being advanced to the throne, is killed by the common
people. The Britons desire the Romans to defend them against Guanius
and Melga.</i></h3>


<p>But Gratian Municeps,<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> hearing of the death of Maximian,
seized the crown, and made himself king. After this he
exercised such tyranny that the common people fell upon
him in a tumultuous manner, and murdered him. When
this news reached other countries, their former enemies returned
back from Ireland, and bringing with them the Scots,
Norwegians, and Dacians, made dreadful devastations with
fire and sword over the whole kingdom, from sea to sea.
Upon this most grievous calamity and oppression, ambassadors
are despatched with letters to Rome, to beseech, with
tears and vows of perpetual subjection, that a body of men
might be sent to revenge their injuries, and drive out the
enemy from them. The ambassadors in a short time prevailed
so far, that, unmindful of past injuries, the Romans
granted them one legion, which was transported in a fleet to
their country, and there speedily encountered the enemy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
At last, after the slaughter of a vast multitude of them, they
drove them entirely out of the country, and rescued the
miserable people from their outrageous cruelty. Then they
gave orders for a wall to be built between Albania and
Deira, from one sea to the other, for a terror to the enemy,
and safeguard to the country. At that time Albania was
wholly laid waste, by the frequent invasions of barbarous
nations; and whatever enemies made an attempt upon the
country, met with a convenient landing-place there. So
that the inhabitants were diligent in working upon the
wall,<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> which they finished partly at the public, partly upon

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. II.</span>&mdash;<i>Guethelin's speech to the Britons when the Romans left them.</i></h3>


<p>The Romans, after this, declared to the Britons, that they
should not be able for the future to undergo the fatigue of
such laborious expeditions; and that it was beneath the dignity
of the Roman state to harass so great and brave an
army, both by land and sea, against base and vagabond robbers;
but that they ought to apply themselves to the use of
arms, and to fight bravely in defending to the utmost of their
power, their country, riches, wives, children, and, what is
dearer than all these, their liberty and lives. As soon as
they had given them this exhortation, they commanded all
the men of the island that were fit for war, to appear
together at London, because the Romans were about to
return home. When, therefore, they were all assembled,
Guethelin, the metropolitan of London, had orders to make
a speech to them, which he did in these words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Though I am appointed by the princes here present to
speak to you, I find myself rather ready to burst into tears,
than to make an eloquent oration. It is a most sensible
affliction to me to observe the weak and destitute state into
which you are fallen since Maximian drew away with him
all the forces and youth of this kingdom. You that were
left were people wholly inexperienced in war, and occupied
with other employments, as tilling the ground, and several
kinds of mechanical trades. So that when your enemies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
from foreign countries came upon you, as sheep wandering
without a shepherd, they forced you to quit your folds, till
the Roman power restored you to them again. Must your
hopes, therefore, always depend upon foreign assistance?
And will you never use yourselves to handle arms against a
band of robbers, that are by no means stronger than yourselves,
if you are not dispirited by sloth and cowardice?
The Romans are now tired with the continual voyages
wherewith they are harassed to defend you against your
enemies: they rather choose to remit to you the tribute
you pay them, than undergo any longer this fatigue by land
and sea. Because you were only the common people at the
time when we had soldiers of our own, do you therefore
think that manhood has quite forsaken you? Are not men
in the course of human generation often the reverse of one
another? Is not a ploughman often the father of a soldier,
and a soldier of a ploughman? Does not the same diversity
happen in a mechanic and a soldier? Since then, in this
manner, one produces another, I cannot think it possible for
manhood to be lost among them. As then you are men, behave
yourselves like men: call upon the name of Christ,
that he may inspire you with courage to defend your
liberties."</p>

<p>No sooner had he concluded his speech, than the people
raised such a shout, that one would have thought them on a
sudden inspired with courage from heaven.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. III.</span>&mdash;<i>The Britons are again cruelly harassed by Guanius and
Melga.</i></h3>


<p>After this the Romans encouraged the timorous people as
much as they could, and left them patterns of their arms.
They likewise commanded towers, having a prospect towards
the sea, to be placed at proper distances along all the south
coast, where their ships were, and from whence they feared
the invasions of the barbarians. But, according to the proverb,
"It is easier to make a hawk of a kite, than a scholar
of a ploughman;" all learning to him is but as a pearl thrown
before swine. Thus, no sooner had the Romans taken their
farewell of them, than the two leaders, Guanius and Melga,
issued forth from their ships, in which they had fled over
into Ireland, and with their bands of Scots, Picts, Norwe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>gians,
Dacians, and others, whom they had brought along
with them, seized upon all Albania as far as the very wall.
Understanding, likewise, that the Romans were gone, never
to return any more, they now, in a more insolent manner
than before, began their devastations in the island. Hereupon
the country fellows upon the battlements of the walls
sat night and day with quaking hearts, not daring to stir
from their seats, and readier for flight than making the least
resistance. In the meantime the enemies ceased not with
their hooks to pull them down headlong, and dash the
wretched herd to pieces upon the ground; who gained at
least this advantage by their speedy death, that they avoided
the sight of that most deplorable calamity, which forthwith
threatened their relations and dearest children. Such was
the terrible vengeance of God for that most wicked madness
of Maximian, in draining the kingdom of all its forces, who,
had they been present, would have repulsed any nation that
invaded them; an evident proof of which they gave, by the
vast conquests they made abroad, even in remote countries;
and also by maintaining their own country in peace, while
they continued here. But thus it happens when a country
is left to the defence of country clowns. In short, quitting
their high wall and their cities, the country people were forced
again to fly, and to suffer a more fatal dispersion, a more
furious pursuit of the enemy, a more cruel and more general
slaughter than before; and like lambs before wolves, so was
that miserable people torn to pieces by the merciless barbarians.
Again, therefore, the wretched remainder send letters
to Agitius, a man of great power among the Romans, to this
effect. "To Agitius,<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> thrice consul, the groans of the
Britons." And after some few other complaints they add:
"The sea drives us to the barbarians, and the barbarians
drive us back to the sea: thus are we tossed to and fro between
two kinds of death, being either drowned or put to
the sword." Notwithstanding this most moving address,
they procured no relief, and the ambassadors returning back
in great heaviness, declared to their countrymen the repulse
which they had suffered.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. IV.</span>&mdash;<i>Guethelin desires succours of Aldroen.</i></h3>


<p>Hereupon, after a consultation together, Guethelin, archbishop
of London, passed over into Lesser Britain, called then
Armorica, or Letavia, to desire assistance of their brethren.
At that time Aldroen reigned there, being the fourth king
from Conan, to whom, as has been already related, Maximian
had given that kingdom. This prince, seeing a prelate of so
great dignity arrive, received him with honour, and inquired
after the occasion of his coming. To whom Guethelin:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Your majesty can be no stranger to the misery which we,
your Britons, have suffered (which may even demand your
tears), since the time that Maximian drained our island of
its soldiers, to people the kingdom which you enjoy, and
which God grant you may long enjoy in peace. For against
us the poor remains of the British race, all the people of the
adjacent islands, have risen up, and made an utter devastation
in our country, which then abounded with all kinds of
riches; so that the people now are wholly destitute of all
manner of sustenance, but what they can get in hunting.
Nor had we any power or knowledge of military affairs left
among us to encounter the enemy. For the Romans are
tired of us, and have absolutely refused their assistance. So
that now, deprived of all other hope, we come to implore
your clemency, that you would furnish us with forces, and
protect a kingdom, which is of right your own, from the incursions
of barbarians. For who but yourself, ought, without
your consent, to wear the crown of Constantine and
Maximian, since the right your ancestors had to it is now
devolved upon you? Prepare then your fleet, and go with
me. Behold! I deliver the kingdom of Britain into your
hands."</p>

<p>To this Aldroen made answer: "There was a time formerly
when I would not have refused to accept of the island
of Britain, if it had been offered me; for I do not think there
was anywhere a more fruitful country while it enjoyed peace
and tranquillity. But now, since the calamities that have
befallen it, it is become of less value, and odious both to me
and all other princes. But above all things the power of the
Romans was so destructive to it, that nobody could enjoy
any settled state or authority in it, without loss of liberty,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
and bearing the yoke of slavery under them. And who
would not prefer the possession of a lesser country with
liberty, to all the riches of that island in servitude? The
kingdom that is now under my subjection I enjoy with
honour, and without paying homage to any superior; so that
I prefer it to all other countries, since I can govern it without
being controlled. Nevertheless, out of respect to the
right that my ancestors for many generations have had to
your island, I deliver to you my brother Constantine with
two thousand men, that with the good providence of God,
he may free your country from the inroads of barbarians,
and obtain the crown for himself. For I have a brother
called by that name, who is an expert soldier, and in all other
respects an accomplished man. If you please to accept of
him, I will not refuse to send him with you, together with
the said number of men; for indeed a larger number I do
not mention to you, because I am daily threatened with disturbance
from the Gauls." He had scarcely done speaking
before the archbishop returned him thanks, and when Constantine
was called in, broke out into these expressions of
joy: "Christ conquers; Christ commands; Christ reigns:
behold the king of desolate Britain! Be Christ only present,
and behold our defence, our hope and joy." In short, the
ships being got ready, the men who were chosen out from
all parts of the kingdom, were delivered to Guethelin.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. V.</span>&mdash;<i>Constantine, being made king of Britain, leaves three sons.</i></h3>


<p>When they had made all necessary preparations, they embarked,
and arrived at the port of Totness; and then without
delay assembled together the youth that was left in the
island, and encountered the enemy; over whom, by the
merit of the holy prelate, they obtained the victory. After
this the Britons, before dispersed, flocked together from all
parts, and in a council held at Silchester, promoted Constantine
to the throne, and there performed the ceremony of his
coronation. They also married him to a lady, descended
from a noble Roman family, whom archbishop Guethelin had
educated, and by whom the king had afterwards three sons,
Constans, Aurelius Ambrosius, and Uther Pendragon. Constans,
who was the eldest, he delivered to the church of Amphibalus
in Winchester, that he might there take upon him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
the monastic order. But the other two, viz. Aurelius and
Uther, he committed to the care of Guethelin for their education.
At last, after ten years were expired, there came a
certain Pict, who had entered in his service, and under pretence
of holding some private discourse with him, in a
nursery of young trees where nobody was present, stabbed
him with a dagger.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. VI.</span>&mdash;<i>Constans is by Vortigern crowned king of Britain.</i></h3>


<p>Upon the death of Constantine, a dissension arose among the
nobility, about a successor to the throne. Some were for
setting up Aurelius Ambrosius; others Uther Pendragon;
others again some other persons of the royal family. At last,
when they could come to no conclusion, Vortigern, consul
of the Gewisseans, who was himself very ambitious of the
crown, went to Constans the monk,<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> and thus addressed
himself to him: "You see your father is dead, and your
brothers on account of their age are incapable of the government;
neither do I see any of your family besides yourself,
whom the people ought to promote to the kingdom. If you
will therefore follow my advice, I will, on condition of your
increasing my private estate, dispose the people to favour
your advancement, and free you from that habit, notwithstanding
that it is against the rule of your order." Constans,
overjoyed at the proposal, promised, with an oath, that upon
these terms he would grant him whatever he would desire.
Then Vortigern took him, and investing him in his regal
habiliments, conducted him to London, and made him king,
though not with the free consent of the people. Archbishop
Guethelin was then dead, nor was there any other
that durst perform the ceremony of his unction, on account
of his having quitted the monastic order. However, this
proved no hindrance to his coronation, for Vortigern himself
performed the ceremony instead of a bishop.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. VII.</span>&mdash;<i>Vortigern treacherously contrives to get king Constans
assassinated.</i></h3>


<p>Constans, being thus advanced, committed the whole
government of the kingdom to Vortigern, and surrendered
himself up so entirely to his counsels, that he did nothing
without his order. His own incapacity for government
obliged him to do this, for he had learned any thing else
rather than state affairs within his cloister. Vortigern
became sensible of this, and therefore began to deliberate
with himself what course to take to obtain the crown, of
which he had been before extremely ambitious. He saw
that now was his proper time to gain his end easily, when
the kingdom was wholly intrusted to his management; and
Constans, who bore the title of king, was no more than the
shadow of one; for he was of a soft temper, a bad judge in
matters of right, and not in the least feared, either by his
own people, or by the neighbouring states. And as for his
two brothers, Uther Pendragon and Aurelius Ambrosius,
they were only children in their cradles, and therefore
incapable of the government. There was likewise this
farther misfortune, that all the older persons of the nobility
were dead, so that Vortigern seemed to be the only man
surviving, that had craft, policy, and experience in matters
of state; and all the rest in a manner children, or raw
youths, who only inherited the honours of their parents and
relations that had been killed in the former wars. Vortigern,
finding a concurrence of so many favourable circumstances,
contrived how he might easily and cunningly depose Constans
the monk, and immediately establish himself in his place.
But in order to do this, he waited until he had first well
established his power and interest in several countries. He
therefore petitioned to have the king's treasures, and his
fortified cities, in his own custody; pretending there was a
rumour, that the neighbouring islanders designed an invasion
of the kingdom. This being granted him, he placed his own
creatures in those cities, to secure them for himself. Then
having formed a scheme how to execute his treasonable
designs, he went to the king, and represented to him the
necessity of augmenting the number of his domestics, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
he might more safely oppose the invasion of the enemy.
"Have not I left all things to your disposal?" said Constans.
"Do what you will as to that, so that they be but faithful to
me." Vortigern replied, "I am informed that the Picts are
going to bring the Dacians and Norwegians in upon us, with
a design to give us very great annoyance. I would therefore
advise you, and in my opinion it is the best course you can
take, that you maintain some Picts in your court, who may
do you good service among those of that nation. For if it
is true that they are preparing to begin a rebellion, you may
employ them as spies upon their countrymen in their plots
and stratagems, so as easily to escape them." This was the
dark treason of a secret enemy; for he did not recommend
this out of regard to the safety of Constans, but because he
knew the Picts to be a giddy people, and ready for all
manner of wickedness; so that, in a fit of drunkenness or
passion, they might easily be incensed against the king, and
make no scruple to assassinate him. And such an accident,
when it should happen, would make an open way for his
accession to the throne, which he so often had in view.
Hereupon he despatched messengers into Scotland, with an
invitation to a hundred Pictish soldiers, whom accordingly
he received into the king's household; and when admitted,
he showed them more respect than all the rest of the domestics,
by making them several presents, and allowing them a
luxurious table, insomuch that they looked upon him as the
king. So great was the regard they had for him, that they
made songs of him about the streets, the subject of which
was, that Vortigern deserved the government, deserved the
sceptre of Britain; but that Constans was unworthy of it.
This encouraged Vortigern to show them still more favour,
in order the more firmly to engage them in his interest; and
when by these practices he had made them entirely his
creatures, he took an opportunity, when they were drunk, to
tell them, that he was going to retire out of Britain, to see if
he could get a better estate; for the small revenue he had
then, he said, would not so much as enable him to maintain a
retinue of fifty men. Then putting on a look of sadness, he
withdrew to his own apartment, and left them drinking in
the hall. The Picts at this sight were in inexpressible sorrow,
as thinking what he had said was true, and murmuring said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
one to another, "Why do we suffer this monk to live? Why
do not we kill him, that Vortigern may enjoy his crown?
Who is so fit to succeed as he? A man so generous to us is
worthy to rule, and deserves all the honour and dignity that
we can bestow upon him."</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. VIII.</span>&mdash;<i>Aurelius Ambrosius and Uther Pendragon flee from
Vortigern, and go to Lesser Britain.</i></h3>


<p>After this, breaking into Constans' bed-chamber, they fell
upon him and killed him, and carried his head to Vortigern.
At the sight of it, he put on a mournful countenance, and
burst forth into tears, though at the same time he was
almost transported with joy. However, he summoned
together the citizens of London, (for there the fact was
committed,) and commanded all the assassins to be bound,
and their heads to be cut off for this abominable parricide.
In the meantime there were some who had a suspicion, that
this piece of villany was wholly the contrivance of Vortigern,
and that the Picts were only his instruments to execute it.
Others again as positively asserted his innocence. At last
the matter being left in doubt, those who had the care of the
two brothers, Aurelius Ambrosius, and Uther Pendragon,
fled over with them into Lesser Britain, for fear of being
killed by Vortigern. There they were kindly received by
king Budes, who took care to give them an education suitable
to their royal birth.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. IX.</span>&mdash;<i>Vortigern makes himself king of Britain.</i></h3>


<p>Now Vortigern, seeing nobody to rival him in the kingdom,
placed the crown on his own head, and thus gained the pre-eminence
over all the rest of the princes. At last his treason
being discovered, the people of the adjacent islands, whom
the Picts had brought into Albania, made insurrection
against him. For the Picts were enraged on account of the
death of their fellow soldiers, who had been slain for the
murder of Constans, and endeavoured to revenge that injury
upon him. Vortigern therefore was daily in great distress,
and lost a considerable part of his army in a war with them.
He had likewise no less trouble from another quarter, for
fear of Aurelius Ambrosius, and his brother Uther Pendra<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>gon,
who, as we said before, had fled, on his account, into
Lesser Britain. For he heard it rumoured, day after day,
that they had now arrived at man's estate, and had built a
vast fleet, with a design to return back to the kingdom, which
was their undoubted right.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. X.</span>&mdash;<i>Vortigern takes the Saxons that were new-comers, to his
assistance.</i></h3>


<p>In the meantime there arrived in Kent three brigandines, or
long galleys, full of armed men, under the command of two
brothers, Horsa and Hengist.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> Vortigern was then at
Dorobernia, now Canterbury, which city he used often to
visit; and being informed of the arrival of some tall
strangers in large ships, he ordered that they should be
received peaceably, and conducted into his presence. As
soon as they were brought before him, he cast his eyes upon
the two brothers, who excelled all the rest both in nobility
and gracefulness of person; and having taken a view of the
whole company, asked them of what country they were, and
what was the occasion of their coming into his kingdom.
To whom Hengist (whose years and wisdom entitled him to
a precedence), in the name of the rest, made the following
answer:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Most noble king, Saxony, which is one of the countries
of Germany, was the place of our birth; and the occasion
of our coming was to offer our service to you or some other
prince. For we were driven out of our native country, for
no other reason, but that the laws of the kingdom required
it. It is customary among us, that when we come to be
overstocked with people, our princes from all the provinces
meet together, and command all the youths of the kingdom
to assemble before them; then casting lots, they make choice
of the strongest and ablest of them, to go into foreign nations,
to procure themselves a subsistence, and free their native
country from a superfluous multitude of people. Our
country, therefore, being of late overstocked, our princes
met, and after having cast lots, made choice of the youth
which you see in your presence, and have obliged us to obey<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
the custom which has been established of old. And us two
brothers, Hengist and Horsa, they made generals over them,
out of respect to our ancestors, who enjoyed the same honour.
In obedience, therefore, to the laws so long established, we
put out to sea, and under the good guidance of Mercury
have arrived in your kingdom."</p>

<p>The king, at the name of Mercury, looking earnestly upon
them, asked them what religion they professed. "We worship,"
replied Hengist, "our country's gods, Saturn and Jupiter,
and the other deities that govern the world, but especially
Mercury, whom in our language we call Woden, and to
whom our ancestors consecrated the fourth day of the week,
still called after his name Wodensday. Next to him we
worship the powerful goddess, Frea, to whom they also dedicated
the sixth day, which after her name we call Friday."
Vortigern replied, "For your credulity, or rather incredulity,
I am much grieved, but I rejoice at your arrival, which,
whether by God's providence or some other agency, happens
very seasonably for me in my present difficulties. For I am
oppressed by my enemies on every side, and if you will
engage with me in my wars, I will entertain you honourably
in my kingdom, and bestow upon you lands and other possessions."
The barbarians readily accepted his offer, and
the agreement between them being ratified, they resided at
his court. Soon after this, the Picts, issuing forth from
Albania, with a very great army, began to lay waste the
northern parts of the island. When Vortigern had information
of it, he assembled his forces, and went to meet them
beyond the Humber. Upon their engaging, the battle
proved very fierce on both sides, though there was but little
occasion for the Britons to exert themselves, for the Saxons
fought so bravely, that the enemy, formerly so victorious,
were speedily put to flight.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XI.</span>&mdash;<i>Hengist brings over great numbers of Saxons into Britain,
his crafty petition to Vortigern.</i></h3>


<p>Vortigern, therefore, as he owed the victory to them, increased
his bounty to them, and gave their general, Hengist,
large possessions of land in Lindesia,<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> for the subsistence of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
himself and his fellow soldiers. Hereupon Hengist, who
was a man of experience and subtilty, finding how much
interest he had with the king, addressed him in this manner:&mdash;"Sir,
your enemies give you disturbance from all quarters,
and few of your subjects love you. They all threaten you,
and say, they are going to bring over Aurelius Ambrosius
from Armorica, to depose you, and make him king. If you
please, let us send to our country to invite over some more
soldiers, that with our forces increased we may be better
able to oppose them. But there is one thing which I would
desire of your clemency, if I did not fear a refusal." Vortigern
made answer, "Send your messengers to Germany, and
invite over whom you please, and you shall have no refusal
from me in whatever you shall desire." Hengist, with a low
bow, returned him thanks, and said, "The possessions which
you have given me in land and houses are very large, but
you have not yet done me that honour which becomes my
station and birth, because, among other things, I should
have had some town or city granted me, that I might be
entitled to greater esteem among the nobility of your kingdom.
I ought to have been made a consul or prince, since
my ancestors enjoyed both those dignities." "It is not in
my power," replied Vortigern, "to do you so much honour,
because you are strangers and pagans; neither am I yet so
far acquainted with your manners and customs, as to set you
upon a level with my natural born subjects. And, indeed,
if I did esteem you as my subjects, I should not be forward
to do so, because the nobility of my kingdom would strongly
dissuade me from it." "Give your servant," said Hengist,
"only so much ground in the place you have assigned me,
as I can encompass with a leathern thong, for to build a fortress
upon, as a place of retreat if occasion should require.
For I will always be faithful to you, as I have been hitherto,
and pursue no other design in the request which I have
made." With these words the king was prevailed upon to
grant him his petition; and ordered him to despatch messengers
into Germany, to invite more men over speedily to his
assistance. Hengist immediately executed his orders, and
taking a bull's hide, made one thong out of the whole, with
which he encompassed a rocky place that he had carefully
made choice of, and within that circuit began to build a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
castle, which, when finished, took its name from the thong
wherewith it had been measured; for it was afterwards
called, in the British tongue, Kaercorrei; in Saxon, Thancastre,
that is, Thong Castle.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>In the meantime, the messengers returned from Germany,
with eighteen ships full of the best soldiers they could get.
They also brought along with them Rowen, the daughter of
Hengist, one of the most accomplished beauties of that age.
After their arrival, Hengist invited the king to his house, to
view his new buildings, and the new soldiers that were
come over. The king readily accepted of his invitation, but
privately, and having highly commended the magnificence of
the structure, enlisted the men into his service. Here he
was entertained at a royal banquet; and when that was
over, the young lady came out of her chamber bearing a
golden cup full of wine, with which she approached the
king, and making a low courtesy, said to him, "Lauerd<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> king
wacht heil!" The king, at the sight of the lady's face, was
on a sudden both surprised and inflamed with her beauty;
and calling to his interpreter, asked him what she said, and
what answer he should make her. "She called you, 'Lord
king,'" said the interpreter, "and offered to drink your health.
Your answer to her must be, 'Drinc heil!'" Vortigern
accordingly answered, "Drinc heil!" and bade her drink;
after which he took the cup from her hand, kissed her, and
drank himself. From that time to this, it has been the
custom in Britain, that he who drinks to any one says,
"Wacht heil!" and he that pledges him, answers "Drinc
heil!" Vortigern being now drunk with the variety of
liquors, the devil took this opportunity to enter into his
heart, and to make him in love with the damsel, so that he
became suitor to her father for her. It was, I say, by the
devil's entering into his heart, that he, who was a Christian,
should fall in love with a pagan. By this example, Hengist,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
being a prudent man, discovered the king's levity, and consulted
with his brother Horsa and the other ancient men
present, what to do in relation to the king's request. They
unanimously advised him to give him his daughter, and in consideration
of her to demand the province of Kent. Accordingly
the daughter was without delay delivered to Vortigern,
and the province of Kent to Hengist, without the knowledge
of Gorangan, who had the government of it. The king the
same night married the pagan lady, and became extremely
delighted with her; by which he quickly brought upon himself
the hatred of the nobility, and of his own sons. For he
had already three sons, whose names were Vortimer, Catigern,
and Pascentius.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XIII.</span>&mdash;<i>The bishops, Germanus and Lupus, restore the Christian
faith that had been corrupted in Britain. Octa and Ebissa are four times routed by Vortimer.</i></h3>


<p>At that time came St. Germanus, bishop of Auxerre, and
Lupus, bishop of Troyes, to preach the gospel to the Britons.
For the Christian faith had been corrupted among them,
partly by the pagans whom the king had brought into
society with them, partly by the Pelagian heresy, with
the poison whereof they had been a long time infected. But
by the preaching of these holy men, the true faith and worship
was again restored, the many miracles they wrought
giving success to their labours. Gildas has in his elegant
treatise given an account of the many miracles God wrought
by them. The king being now, as we have said, possessed
of the lady, Hengist said to him: "As I am your father, I
claim the right of being your counsellor: do not therefore
slight my advice, since it is to my countrymen you must owe
the conquest of all your enemies. Let us invite over my
son Octa and his brother Ebissa, who are brave soldiers, and
give them the countries that are in the northern parts of
Britain, by the wall, between Deira and Albania. For they
will hinder the inroads of the barbarians, and so you shall
enjoy peace on the other side of the Humber." Vortigern
complied with his request, and ordered them to invite over
whomsoever they knew able to assist him. Immediately
upon the receipt of this message, came Octa, Ebissa, and
Cherdich, with three hundred ships filled with soldiers, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
were all kindly received by Vortigern, and had ample
presents made them. For by their assistance he vanquished
his enemies, and in every engagement proved victorious.
Hengist in the meantime continued to invite over more and
more ships, and to augment his numbers daily. Which
when the Britons observed, they were afraid of being betrayed
by them, and moved the king to banish them out of
his coasts. For it was contrary to the rule of the gospel
that Christians should hold fellowship, or have any intercourse,
with pagans. Besides which, the number of those
that were come over was now so great, that they were a
terror to his subjects; and nobody could now know who was
a pagan, or who a Christian, since pagans married the
daughters and kinswomen of Christians. These things they
represented to the king, and endeavoured to dissuade him
from entertaining them, lest they might, by some treacherous
conspiracy, prove an overmatch for the native inhabitants.
But Vortigern, who loved them above all other nations on
account of his wife, was deaf to their advice. For this reason
the Britons quickly desert him, and unanimously set up Vortimer
his son for their king; who at their instigation began to
drive out the barbarians, and to make dreadful incursions upon
them. Four battles he fought with them, and was victorious
in all: the first upon the river Dereuent;<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> the second upon
the ford of Epsford, where Horsa and Catigern, another
son of Vortigern, met and, after a sharp encounter, killed
each other;<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> the third upon the sea-shore, where the enemies
fled shamefully to their ships, and betook themselves for
refuge to the Isle of Thanet. But Vortimer besieged them
there, and daily distressed them with his fleet. And when
they were no longer able to bear the assaults of the Britons,
they sent king Vortigern, who was present with them in all
those wars, to his son Vortimer, to desire leave to depart,
and return back safe to Germany. And while a conference
upon this subject was being held, they in the meantime
went on board their long galleys, and, leaving their
wives and children behind them, returned back to Germany.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XIV.</span>&mdash;<i>Vortimer's kindness to his soldiers at his death.</i></h3>


<p>Vortimer, after this great success, began to restore his subjects
to their possessions which had been taken from them,
and to show them all marks of his affection and esteem, and at
the instance of St. Germanus to rebuild their churches. But
his goodness quickly stirred up the enmity of the devil
against him, who entering into the heart of his stepmother
Rowen, excited her to contrive his death. For this purpose
she consulted with the poisoners, and procured one who was
intimate with him, whom she corrupted with large and
numerous presents, to give him a poisonous draught; so that
this brave soldier, as soon as he had taken it, was seized with
a sudden illness, that deprived him of all hopes of life. Hereupon
he forthwith ordered all his men to come to him, and
having shown them how near he was to his end, distributed
among them all the treasure his predecessors had heaped up,
and endeavoured to comfort them in their sorrow and lamentation
for him, telling them, he was only going the way of
all flesh. But he exhorted those brave and warlike young
men, who had attended him in all his victories, to persist
courageously in the defence of their country against all hostile
invasion; and with wonderful greatness of mind, commanded
a brazen pyramid to be placed in the port where the Saxons
used to land, and his body when dead to be buried on the
top of it, that the sight of his tomb might frighten back the
barbarians to Germany. For he said none of them would
dare approach the country, that should but get a sight of his
tomb. Such was the admirable bravery of this great man,
who, as he had been a terror to them while living, endeavoured
to be no less so when dead. Notwithstanding
which, he was no sooner dead, than the Britons had no
regard to his orders, but buried him at London.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XV.</span>&mdash;<i>Hengist, having wickedly murdered the princes of Britain,
keeps Vortigern prisoner.</i></h3>


<p>Vortigern, after the death of his son, was again restored to
the kingdom, and at the request of his wife sent messengers
into Germany to Hengist, with an invitation to return into
Britain, but privately, and with a small retinue, to prevent a
quarrel between the barbarians and his subjects. But Hen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>gist,
hearing that Vortimer was dead, raised an army of no
less than three hundred thousand men, and fitting out a fleet
returned with them to Britain. When Vortigern and the
nobility heard of the arrival of so vast a multitude, they were
immoderately incensed, and, after consultation together, resolved
to fight them, and drive them from their coasts.
Hengist, being informed of their design by messengers sent
from his daughter, immediately entered into deliberation
what course to pursue against them. After several stratagems
had been considered, he judged it most feasible, to impose
upon the nation by making show of peace. With this
view he sent ambassadors to the king, to declare to him, that
he had not brought so great a number of men for the purpose
either of staying with him, or offering any violence to
the country. But the reason why he brought them, was
because he thought Vortimer was yet living, and that he
should have occasion for them against him, in case of an
assault. But now since he no longer doubted of his being
dead, he submitted himself and his people to the disposal of
Vortigern; so that he might retain as many of them as he
should think fit, and whomsoever he rejected Hengist would
allow to return back without delay to Germany. And if
these terms pleased Vortigern, he desired him to appoint a
time and place for their meeting, and adjusting matters
according to his pleasure. When these things were represented
to the king, he was mightily pleased, as being very
unwilling to part with Hengist; and at last ordered his subjects
and the Saxons to meet upon the kalends of May, which
were now very near, at the monastery of Ambrius,<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> for the
settling of the matters above-mentioned. The appointment
being agreed to on both sides, Hengist, with a new design of
villany in his head, ordered his soldiers to carry every one
of them a long dagger under their garments; and while the
conference should be held with the Britons, who would have
no suspicion of them, he would give them this word of command,
"Nemet oure Saxas;" at which moment they were all
to be ready to seize boldly every one his next man, and with
his drawn dagger stab him. Accordingly they all met at the
time and place appointed, and began to treat of peace; and
when a fit opportunity offered for executing his villany,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
Hengist cried out, "Nemet oure Saxas," and the same instant
seized Vortigern, and held him by his cloak. The
Saxons, upon the signal given, drew their daggers, and falling
upon the princes, who little suspected any such design,
assassinated them to the number of four hundred and sixty
barons and consuls; to whose bodies St. Eldad afterwards
gave Christian burial, not far from Kaercaradoc, now Salisbury,
in a burying-place near the monastery of Ambrius, the
abbat, who was the founder of it. For they all came without
arms, having no thoughts of anything but treating of peace;
which gave the others a fairer opportunity of exercising their
villainous design against them. But the pagans did not
escape unpunished while they acted this wickedness; a great
number of them being killed during this massacre of their
enemies. For the Britons, taking up clubs and stones from
the ground, resolutely defended themselves, and did good
execution upon the traitors.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XVI.</span>&mdash;<i>Eldol's valiant exploit. Hengist forces Vortigern to yield
up the strongest fortifications in Britain, in consideration of his release.</i></h3>


<p>There was present one Eldol, consul<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> of Gloucester, who,
at the sight of this treachery, took up a stake which he happened
to find, and with that made his defence. Every blow
he gave carried death along with it; and by breaking
either the head, arms, shoulders, or legs of a great many, he
struck no small terror into the traitors, nor did he move from
the spot before he had killed with that weapon seventy men.
But being no longer able to stand his ground against such
numbers, he made his escape from them, and retired to his
own city. Many fell on both sides, but the Saxons got the
victory; because the Britons, having no suspicion of treachery,
came unarmed, and therefore made a weaker defence. After
the commission of this detestable villany, the Saxons would
not kill Vortigern; but having threatened him with death
and bound him, demanded his cities and fortified places in
consideration of their granting him his life. He, to secure
himself, denied them nothing; and when they had made him
confirm his grants with an oath, they released him from his
chains, and then marched first to London, which they took,
as they did afterwards York, Lincoln, and Winchester;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
wasting the countries through which they passed, and destroying
the people, as wolves do sheep when left by their
shepherds. When Vortigern saw the desolation which they
made, he retired into the parts of Cambria, not knowing
what to do against so barbarous a people.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XVII.</span>&mdash;<i>Vortigern, after consultation with magicians, orders a
youth to be brought that never had a father.</i></h3>


<p>At last he had recourse to magicians for their advice, and
commanded them to tell him what course to take. They
advised him to build a very strong tower for his own safety,
since he had lost all his other fortified places. Accordingly
he made a progress about the country, to find out a convenient
situation, and came at last to Mount Erir, where he
assembled workmen from several countries, and ordered them
to build the tower. The builders, therefore, began to lay
the foundation; but whatever they did one day the earth
swallowed up the next, so as to leave no appearance of their
work. Vortigern being informed of this again consulted
with his magicians concerning the cause of it, who told him
that he must find out a youth that never had a father, and
kill him, and then sprinkle the stones and cement with his
blood; for by those means, they said, he would have a firm
foundation. Hereupon messengers were despatched away
over all the provinces, to inquire out such a man. In their
travels they came to a city, called afterwards Kaermerdin,
where they saw some young men, playing before the gate,
and went up to them; but being weary with their journey,
they sat down in the ring, to see if they could meet with
what they were in quest of. Towards evening, there happened
on a sudden a quarrel between two of the young men,
whose names were Merlin and Dabutius. In the dispute,
Dabutius said to Merlin: "You fool, do you presume to
quarrel with me? Is there any equality in our birth? I am
descended of royal race, both by my father and mother's side.
As for you, nobody knows what you are, for you never had a
father." At that word the messengers looked earnestly upon
Merlin, and asked the by-standers who he was. They told
him, it was not known who was his father; but that his
mother was daughter to the king of Dimetia, and that she
lived in St. Peter's church among the nuns of that city.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XVIII.</span>&mdash;<i>Vortigern inquires of Merlin's mother concerning her
conception of him.</i></h3>


<p>Upon this the messengers hastened to the governor of the
city, and ordered him, in the king's name, to send Merlin and
his mother to the king. As soon as the governor understood
the occasion of their message, he readily obeyed the order,
and sent them to Vortigern to complete his design. When
they were introduced into the king's presence, he received
the mother in a very respectful manner, on account of her
noble birth; and began to inquire of her by what man she
had conceived. "My sovereign lord," said she, "by the life
of your soul and mine, I know nobody that begot him of me.
Only this I know, that as I was once with my companions in
our chambers, there appeared to me a person in the shape of
a most beautiful young man, who often embraced me eagerly
in his arms, and kissed me; and when he had stayed a little
time, he suddenly vanished out of my sight. But many
times after this he would talk with me when I sat alone,
without making any visible appearance. When he had a
long time haunted me in this manner, he at last lay with me
several times in the shape of a man, and left me with child.
And I do affirm to you, my sovereign lord, that excepting
that young man, I know no body that begot him of
me." The king full of admiration at this account, ordered
Maugantius to be called, that he might satisfy him as to the
possibility of what the woman had related. Maugantius,
being introduced, and having the whole matter repeated to
him, said to Vortigern: "In the books of our philosophers,
and in a great many histories, I have found that several men
have had the like original. For, as Apuleius informs us in
his book concerning the Demon of Socrates, between the
moon and the earth inhabit those spirits, which we will call
incubuses. These are of the nature partly of men, and
partly of angels, and whenever they please assume human
shapes, and lie with women. Perhaps one of them appeared
to this woman, and begot that young man of her."</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XIX.</span>&mdash;<i>Merlin 's speech to the king's magicians, and advice about
the building of the tower.</i></h3>


<p>Merlin in the meantime was attentive to all that had
passed, and then approached the king, and said to him, "For<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
what reason am I and my mother introduced into your presence?"&mdash;"My
magicians," answered Vortigern, "advised
me to seek out a man that had no father, with whose blood
my building is to be sprinkled, in order to make it stand."&mdash;"Order
your magicians," said Merlin, "to come before me,
and I will convict them of a lie." The king was surprised
at his words, and presently ordered the magicians to come,
and sit down before Merlin, who spoke to them after this
manner: "Because you are ignorant what it is that hinders
the foundation of the tower, you have recommended the
shedding of my blood for cement to it, as if that would presently
make it stand. But tell me now, what is there under
the foundation? For something there is that will not suffer
it to stand." The magicians at this began to be afraid, and
made him no answer. Then said Merlin, who was also called
Ambrose, "I entreat your majesty would command your
workmen to dig into the ground, and you will find a pond
which causes the foundation to sink." This accordingly was
done, and then presently they found a pond deep under
ground, which had made it give way. Merlin after this went
again to the magicians, and said, "Tell me ye false sycophants,
what is there under the pond." But they were
silent. Then said he again to the king, "Command the pond
to be drained, and at the bottom you will see two hollow
stones, and in them two dragons asleep." The king made
no scruple of believing him, since he had found true what
he said of the pond, and therefore ordered it to be drained:
which done, he found as Merlin had said; and now was
possessed with the greatest admiration of him. Nor were
the rest that were present less amazed at his wisdom, thinking
it to be no less than divine inspiration.</p>

obliged to publish his prophecies at the request of my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
acquaintance, but especially of Alexander, bishop of Lincoln,
a prelate of the greatest piety and wisdom. There was not
any person, either among the clergy or laity, that was attended
with such a train of knights and noblemen, whom
his settled piety and great munificence engaged in his
service. Out of a desire, therefore, to gratify him, I translated
these prophecies, and sent them to him with the
following letter.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. II.</span>&mdash;<i>Geoffrey's letter to Alexander, bishop of Lincoln.</i></h3>


<p>"The regard which I owe to your great worth, most noble
prelate, has obliged me to undertake the translation of Merlin's
prophecies out of British into Latin, before I had made
an end of the history which I had begun concerning the acts
of the British kings. For my design was to have finished
that first, and afterwards to have taken this work in hand;
lest by being engaged on both at once, I should be less
capable of attending with any exactness to either. Notwithstanding,
since the deference which is paid to your penetrating
judgment will screen me from censure, I have employed
my rude pen, and in a coarse style present you with a translation
out of a language with which you are unacquainted.
At the same time, I cannot but wonder at your recommending
this matter to one of my low genius, when you might
have caused so many men of greater learning, and a richer
vein of intellect, to undertake it; who, with their sublime
strains, would much more agreeably have entertained you.
Besides, without any disparagement to all the philosophers
in Britain, I must take the liberty to say, that you yourself,
if the business of your high station would give you leisure,
are capable of furnishing us with loftier productions of this
kind than any man living. However, since it was your
pleasure that Geoffrey of Monmouth should be employed in
this prophecy, he hopes you will favourably accept of his
performance, and vouchsafe to give a finer turn to whatever
you shall find unpolished, or otherwise faulty in it."</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. III.</span>&mdash;<i>The prophecy of Merlin.</i></h3>


<p>As Vortigern, king of the Britons, was sitting upon the
bank of the drained pond, the two dragons, one of which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
was white, the other red, came forth, and, approaching one
another, began a terrible fight, and cast forth fire with their
breath. But the white dragon had the advantage, and made
the other fly to the end of the lake. And he, for grief at
his flight, renewed the assault upon his pursuer, and forced
him to retire. After this battle of the dragons, the king
commanded Ambrose Merlin to tell him what it portended.
Upon which he, bursting into tears, delivered what his prophetical
spirit suggested to him, as follows:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>"Woe to the red dragon, for his banishment hasteneth on.
His lurking holes shall be seized by the white dragon, which
signifies the Saxons whom you invited over; but the red
denotes the British nation, which shall be oppressed by
the white. Therefore shall its mountains be levelled as the
valleys, and the rivers of the valleys shall run with blood.
The exercise of religion shall be destroyed, and churches
be laid open to ruin. At last the oppressed shall prevail,
and oppose the cruelty of foreigners. For a boar of Cornwall
shall give his assistance, and trample their necks under
his feet. The islands of the ocean shall be subject to his
power, and he shall possess the forests of Gaul. The house
of Romulus shall dread his courage, and his end shall be
doubtful. He shall be celebrated in the mouths of the
people; and his exploits shall be food to those that relate them.
Six of his posterity shall sway the sceptre, but after them
shall arise a German worm. He shall be advanced by a sea-wolf,
whom the woods of Africa shall accompany. Religion
shall be again abolished, and there shall be a translation of
the metropolitan sees. The dignity of London shall adorn
Dorobernia, and the seventh pastor of York shall be resorted
to in the kingdom of Armorica. Menevia shall put on the
pall of the City of Legions, and a preacher of Ireland shall
be dumb on account of an infant growing in the womb. It
shall rain a shower of blood, and a raging famine shall afflict
mankind. When these things happen, the red one shall be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
grieved; but when his fatigue is over, shall grow strong.
Then shall misfortunes hasten upon the white one,
and the buildings of his gardens shall be pulled down.
Seven that sway the sceptre shall be killed, one of whom
shall become a saint. The wombs of mothers shall be ripped
up, and infants be abortive. There shall be a most grievous
punishment of men, that the natives may be restored. He
that shall do these things shall put on the brazen man, and
upon a brazen horse shall for a long time guard the gates of
London. After this, shall the red dragon return to his
proper manners, and turn his rage upon himself. Therefore
shall the revenge of the Thunderer show itself, for every
field shall disappoint the husbandmen. Mortality shall
snatch away the people, and make a desolation over all
countries. The remainder shall quit their native soil, and
make foreign plantations. A blessed king shall prepare a
fleet, and shall be reckoned the twelfth in the court among the
saints. There shall be a miserable desolation of the kingdom,
and the floors of the harvests shall return to the fruitful
forests. The white dragon shall rise again, and invite
over a daughter of Germany. Our gardens shall be again
replenished with foreign seed, and the red one shall pine
away at the end of the pond. After that, shall the German
worm be crowned, and the brazen prince buried. He has
his bounds assigned him, which he shall not be able to pass.
For a hundred and fifty years he shall continue in trouble
and subjection, but shall bear sway three hundred. Then
shall the north wind rise against him, and shall snatch away
the flowers which the west wind produced. There shall be
gilding in the temples, nor shall the edge of the sword cease.
The German dragon shall hardly get to his holes, because the
revenge of his treason shall overtake him. At last he shall
flourish for a little time, but the decimation of Neustria shall
hurt him. For a people in wood and in iron coats shall
come, and revenge upon him his wickedness. They shall
restore the ancient inhabitants to their dwellings, and there
shall be an open destruction of foreigners. The seed of the
white dragon shall be swept out of our gardens, and the
remainder of his generation shall be decimated. They shall
bear the yoke of slavery, and wound their mother with
spades and ploughs. After this shall succeed two dragons,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
whereof one shall be killed with the sting of envy, but the
other shall return under the shadow of a name. Then shall
succeed a lion of justice, at whose roar the Gallican towers
and the island dragons shall tremble. In those days gold
shall be squeezed from the lily and the nettle, and silver shall
flow from the hoofs of bellowing cattle. The frizzled shall
put on various fleeces, and the outward habit denote the inward
parts. The feet of barkers shall be cut off; wild
beasts shall enjoy peace; mankind shall be grieved at their
punishment; the form of commerce shall be divided; the
half shall be round. The ravenousness of kites shall be destroyed,
and the teeth of wolves blunted. The lion's whelps
shall be transformed into sea-fishes; and an eagle shall build
her nest upon Mount Aravius. Venedotia shall grow red
with the blood of mothers, and the house of Corineus kill
six brethren. The island shall be wet with night tears; so
that all shall be provoked to all things. Woe to thee, Neustria,
because the lion's brain shall be poured upon thee: and
he shall be banished with shattered limbs from his native
soil. Posterity shall endeavour to fly above the highest
places; but the favour of new comers shall be exalted.
Piety shall hurt the possessor of things got by impiety, till
he shall have put on his Father: therefore, being armed with
the teeth of a boar, he shall ascend above the tops of mountains,
and the shadow of him that wears a helmet. Albania
shall be enraged, and, assembling her neighbours, shall be
employed in shedding blood. There shall be put into her
jaws a bridle that shall be made on the coast of Armorica.
The eagle of the broken covenant shall gild it over, and rejoice
in her third nest. The roaring whelps shall watch,
and, leaving the woods, shall hunt within the walls of cities.
They shall make no small slaughter of those that oppose
them, and shall cut off the tongues of bulls. They shall
load the necks of roaring lions with chains, and restore the
times of their ancestors. Then from the first to the fourth,
from the fourth to the third, from the third to the second,
the thumb shall roll in oil. The sixth shall overturn the
walls of Ireland, and change the woods into a plain. He
shall reduce several parts to one, and be crowned with the
head of a lion. His beginning shall lay open to wandering
affection, but his end shall carry him up to the blessed, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
are above. For he shall restore the seats of saints in their
countries, and settle pastors in convenient places. Two
cities he shall invest with two palls, and shall bestow virgin-presents
upon virgins. He shall merit by this the favour of
the Thunderer, and shall be placed among the saints. From
him shall proceed a lynx penetrating all things, who shall be
bent upon the ruin of his own nation; for, through him,
Neustria shall lose both islands, and be deprived of its
ancient dignity. Then shall the natives return back to the
island; for there shall arise a dissension among foreigners.
Also a hoary old man, sitting upon a snow-white horse,
shall turn the course of the river Periron, and shall measure
out a mill upon it with a white rod. Cadwallader shall call
upon Conan, and take Albania into alliance. Then shall
there be a slaughter of foreigners; then shall the rivers run
with blood. Then shall break forth the fountains of Armorica,
and they shall be crowned with the diadem of Brutus.
Cambria shall be filled with joy; and the oaks of Cornwall
shall flourish. The island shall be called by the name of
Brutus: and the name given it by foreigners shall be
abolished. From Conan shall proceed a warlike boar, that
shall exercise the sharpness of his tusks within the Gallic
woods. For he shall cut down all the larger oaks, and shall
be a defence to the smaller. The Arabians and Africans
shall dread him; for he shall pursue his furious course to
the farther part of Spain. There shall succeed the goat of
the Venereal castle, having golden horns and a silver beard,
who shall breathe such a cloud out of his nostrils, as shall
darken the whole surface of the island. There shall be
peace in his time; and corn shall abound by reason of the
fruitfulness of the soil. Women shall become serpents in
their gait, and all their motions shall be full of pride. The
camp of Venus shall be restored; nor shall the arrows of
Cupid cease to wound. The fountain of a river shall be
turned into blood; and two kings shall fight a duel at Stafford
for a lioness. Luxury shall overspread the whole
ground; and fornication not cease to debauch mankind. All
these things shall three ages see; till the buried kings shall
be exposed to public view in the city of London. Famine shall
again return; mortality shall return; and the inhabitants
shall grieve for the destruction of their cities. Then shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
come the board of commerce, who shall recall the scattered
flocks to the pasture they had lost. His breast shall be food
to the hungry, and his tongue drink to the thirsty. Out of
his mouth shall flow rivers, that shall water the parched jaws
of men. After this shall be produced a tree upon the
Tower of London, which, having no more than three
branches, shall overshadow the surface of the whole island
with the breadth of its leaves. Its adversary, the north
wind, shall come upon it, and with its noxious blast shall
snatch away the third branch; but the two remaining ones
shall possess its place, till they shall destroy one another
by the multitude of their leaves; and then shall it obtain
the place of those two, and shall give sustenance to
birds of foreign nations. It shall be esteemed hurtful to
native fowls; for they shall not be able to fly freely for fear
of its shadow. There shall succeed the ass of wickedness,
swift against the goldsmiths, but slow against the ravenousness
of wolves. In those days the oaks of the forests shall
burn, and acorns grow upon the branches of teil trees.
The Severn sea shall discharge itself through seven mouths,
and the river Uske burn seven months. Fishes shall die
with the heat thereof; and of them shall be engendered
serpents. The baths of Badon shall grow cold, and their
salubrious waters engender death. London shall mourn for
the death of twenty thousand; and the river Thames shall
be turned into blood. The monks in their cowls shall be
forced to marry, and their cry shall be heard upon the
mountains of the Alps."</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. IV.</span>&mdash;<i>The continuation of the prophecy.</i></h3>


<p>"Three springs shall break forth in the city of Winchester,
whose rivulets shall divide the island into three parts.
Whoever shall drink of the first, shall enjoy long life, and
shall never be afflicted with sickness. He that shall drink
of the second, shall die of hunger, and paleness and horror
shall sit in his countenance. He that shall drink of the
third, shall be surprised with sudden death, neither shall his
body be capable of burial. Those that are willing to escape
so great a surfeit, will endeavour to hide it with several
coverings, but whatever bulk shall be laid upon it, shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
receive the form of another body. For earth shall be turned
into stones; stones into water; wood into ashes; ashes into
water, if cast over it. Also a damsel shall be sent from the
city of the forest of Canute to administer a cure, who, after
she shall have practised all her arts, shall dry up the noxious
fountains only with her breath. Afterwards, as soon as she
shall have refreshed herself with the wholesome liquor, she
shall bear in her right hand the wood of Caledon, and in her
left the forts of the walls of London. Wherever she shall
go, she shall make sulphureous steps, which will smoke with
a double flame. That smoke shall rouse up the city of
Ruteni, and shall make food for the inhabitants of the deep.
She shall overflow with rueful tears, and shall fill the island
with her dreadful cry. She shall be killed by a hart with
ten branches, four of which shall bear golden diadems; but
the other six shall be turned into buffalo's horns, whose
hideous sound shall astonish the three islands of Britain.
The Daneian wood shall be stirred up, and breaking forth
into a human voice, shall cry: Come, O Cambria, and join
Cornwall to thy side, and say to Winchester, the earth shall
swallow thee up. Translate the seat of thy pastor to the
place where ships come to harbour, and the rest of the
members will follow the head. For the day hasteneth, in
which thy citizens shall perish on account of the guilt of
perjury. The whiteness of wool has been hurtful to thee,
and the variety of its tinctures. Woe to the perjured nation,
for whose sake the renowned city shall come to ruin. The
ships shall rejoice at so great an augmentation, and one shall
be made out of two. It shall be rebuilt by Eric, loaden with
apples, to the smell whereof the birds of several woods shall
flock together. He shall add to it a vast palace, and wall it
round with six hundred towers. Therefore shall London
envy it, and triply increase her walls. The river Thames
shall encompass it round, and the fame of the work shall pass
beyond the Alps. Eric shall hide his apples within it, and
shall make subterraneous passages. At that time shall the
stones speak, and the sea towards the Gallic coast be contracted
into a narrow space. On each bank shall one man
hear another, and the soil of the island shall be enlarged.
The secrets of the deep shall be revealed, and Gaul shall
tremble for fear. After these things shall come forth a hern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
from the forest of Calaterium, which shall fly round the
island for two years together. With her nocturnal cry she
shall call together the winged kind, and assemble to her all
sorts of fowls. They shall invade the tillage of husbandmen,
and devour all the grain of the harvests. Then shall follow
a famine upon the people, and a grievous mortality upon the
famine. But when this calamity shall be over, a detestable
bird shall go to the valley of Galabes, and shall raise it to
be a high mountain. Upon the top thereof it shall also plant
an oak, and build its nest in its branches. Three eggs shall
be produced in the nest, from whence shall come forth a fox,
a wolf, and a bear. The fox shall devour her mother, and
bear the head of an ass. In this monstrous form shall she
frighten her brothers, and make them fly into Neustria. But
they shall stir up the tusky boar, and returning in a fleet
shall encounter with the fox; who at the beginning of the
fight shall feign herself dead, and move the boar to compassion.
Then shall the boar approach her carcass, and
standing over her, shall breathe upon her face and eyes.
But she, not forgetting her cunning, shall bite his left foot,
and pluck it off from his body. Then shall she leap upon
him, and snatch away his right ear and tail, and hide herself
in the caverns of the mountains. Therefore shall the deluded
boar require the wolf and bear to restore him his members;
who, as soon as they shall enter into the cause, shall promise
two feet of the fox, together with the ear and tail, and of
these they shall make up the members of a hog. With this
he shall be satisfied, and expect the promised restitution.
In the meantime shall the fox descend from the mountains,
and change herself into a wolf, and under pretence of holding
a conference with the boar, she shall go to him, and craftily
devour him. After that she shall transform herself into a
boar, and feigning a loss of some members, shall wait for her
brothers; but as soon as they are come, she shall suddenly
kill them with her tusks, and shall be crowned with the head
of a lion. In her days shall a serpent be brought forth,
which shall be a destroyer of mankind. With its length it
shall encompass London, and devour all that pass by it. The
mountain ox shall take the head of a wolf, and whiten his
teeth in the Severn. He shall gather to him the flocks of Albania
and Cambria, which shall drink the river Thames dry.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
The ass shall call the goat with the long beard, and shall
borrow his shape. Therefore shall the mountain ox be
incensed, and having called the wolf, shall become a horned
bull against them. In the exercise of his cruelty he shall
devour their flesh and bones, but shall be burned upon the
top of Urian. The ashes of his funeral-pile shall be turned
into swans, that shall swim on dry ground as on a river.
They shall devour fishes in fishes, and swallow up men in
men. But when old age shall come upon them, they shall
become sea-wolves, and practise their frauds in the deep.
They shall drown ships, and collect no small quantity of
silver. The Thames shall again flow, and assembling
together the rivers, shall pass beyond the bounds of its
channel. It shall cover the adjacent cities, and overturn
the mountains that oppose its course. Being full of deceit
and wickedness, it shall make use of the fountain Galabes.
Hence shall arise factions provoking the Venedotians to war.
The oaks of the forest shall meet together, and encounter the
rocks of the Gewisseans. A raven shall attend with the
kites, and devour the carcasses of the slain. An owl shall
build her nest upon the walls of Gloucester, and in her nest
shall be brought forth an ass. The serpent of Malvernia
shall bring him up, and put him upon many fraudulent practices.
Having taken the crown, he shall ascend on high, and
frighten the people of the country with his hideous braying.
In his days shall the Pachaian mountains tremble, and the
provinces be deprived of their woods. For there shall come
a worm with a fiery breath, and with the vapour it sends
forth shall burn up the trees. Out of it shall proceed seven
lions deformed with the heads of goats. With the stench
of their nostrils they shall corrupt women, and make wives
turn common prostitutes. The father shall not know his
own son, because they shall grow wanton like brute beasts.
Then shall come the giant of wickedness, and terrify all with
the sharpness of his eyes. Against him shall arise the
dragon of Worcester, and shall endeavour to banish him.
But in the engagement the dragon shall be worsted, and
oppressed by the wickedness of the conqueror. For he shall
mount upon the dragon, and putting off his garment shall sit
upon him naked. The dragon shall bear him up on high,
and beat his naked rider with his tail erected. Upon this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
the giant rousing up his whole strength, shall break his jaws
with his sword. At last the dragon shall fold itself up
under its tail, and die of poison. After him shall succeed
the boar of Totness, and oppress the people with grievous
tyranny. Gloucester shall send forth a lion, and shall
disturb him in his cruelty, in several battles. He shall
trample him under his feet, and terrify him with open jaws.
At last the lion shall quarrel with the kingdom, and get upon
the backs of the nobility. A bull shall come into the quarrel,
and strike the lion with his right foot. He shall drive him
through all the inns in the kingdom, but shall break his
horns against the walls of Oxford. The fox of Kaerdubalem
shall take revenge on the lion, and destroy him entirely with
her teeth. She shall be encompassed by the adder of Lincoln,
who with a horrible hiss shall give notice of his presence to
a multitude of dragons. Then shall the dragons encounter,
and tear one another to pieces. The winged shall oppress
that which wants wings, and fasten its claws into the
poisonous cheeks. Others shall come into the quarrel, and
kill one another. A fifth shall succeed those that are slain,
and by various stratagems shall destroy the rest. He shall
get upon the back of one with his sword, and sever his head
from his body. Then throwing off his garment, he shall get
upon another, and put his right and left hand upon his tail.
Thus being naked shall he overcome him, whom when
clothed he was not able to deal with. The rest he shall
gall in their flight, and drive them round the kingdom.
Upon this shall come a roaring lion dreadful for his
monstrous cruelty. Fifteen parts shall he reduce to one,
and shall alone possess the people. The giant of the snow-white
colour shall shine, and cause the white people to
flourish. Pleasures shall effeminate the princes, and they
shall suddenly be changed into beasts. Among them shall
arise a lion swelled with human gore. Under him shall a
reaper be placed in the standing corn, who, while he is
reaping, shall be oppressed by him. A charioteer of York
shall appease them, and having banished his lord, shall
mount upon the chariot which he shall drive. With his
sword unsheathed shall he threaten the East, and fill the
tracks of his wheels with blood. Afterwards he shall
become a sea-fish, who, being roused up with the hissing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
of a serpent, shall engender with him. From hence shall
be produced three thundering bulls, who having eaten up
their pastures shall be turned into trees. The first
shall carry a whip of vipers, and turn his back upon
the next. He shall endeavour to snatch away the whip,
but shall be taken by the last. They shall turn away their
faces from one another, till they have thrown away the
poisoned cup. To him shall succeed a husbandman of
Albania, at whose back shall be a serpent. He shall be
employed in ploughing the ground, that the country may
become white with corn. The serpent shall endeavour to
diffuse his poison, in order to blast the harvest. A grievous
mortality shall sweep away the people, and the walls of cities
shall be made desolate. There shall be given for a remedy
the city of Claudius, which shall interpose the nurse of the
scourger. For she shall bear a dose of medicine, and in a
short time the island shall be restored. Then shall two
successively sway the sceptre, whom a horned dragon shall
serve. One shall come in armour, and shall ride upon a
flying serpent. He shall sit upon his back with his naked
body, and cast his right hand upon his tail. With his cry
shall the seas be moved and he shall strike terror into the
second. The second therefore shall enter into confederacy
with the lion; but a quarrel happening, they shall encounter
one another. They shall distress one another, but the
courage of the beast shall gain the advantage. Then shall
come one with a drum, and appease the rage of the lion.
Therefore shall the people of the kingdom be at peace, and
provoke the lion to a dose of physic. In his established seat
he shall adjust the weights, but shall stretch out his hands
into Albania. For which reason the northern provinces
shall be grieved, and open the gates of the temples. The
sign-bearing wolf shall lead his troops, and surround
Cornwall with his tail. He shall be opposed by a soldier in
a chariot, who shall transform that people into a boar. The
boar shall therefore ravage the provinces, but shall hide his
head in the depth of Severn. A man shall embrace a lion
in wine, and the dazzling brightness of gold shall blind the
eyes of beholders. Silver shall whiten in the circumference,
and torment several wine presses. Men shall be drunk with
wine, and, regardless of heaven, shall be intent upon the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
earth. From them shall the stars turn away their faces, and
confound their usual course. Corn will wither at their
malign aspects; and there shall fall no dew from heaven.
The roots and branches will change their places, and the
novelty of the thing shall pass for a miracle. The brightness
of the sun shall fade at the amber of Mercury, and horror
shall seize the beholders. Stilbon of Arcadia shall change
his shield; the helmet of Mars shall call Venus. The
helmet of Mars shall make a shadow; and the rage of
Mercury pass his bounds. Iron Orion shall unsheath his
sword: the marine Ph&oelig;bus shall torment the clouds;
Jupiter shall go out of his lawful paths; and Venus
forsake her stated lines. The malignity of the star Saturn
shall fall down in rain, and slay mankind with a crooked
sickle. The twelve houses of the star shall lament the
irregular excursions of their guests; and Gemini omit their
usual embraces, and call the urn to the fountains. The
scales of Libra shall hang obliquely, till Aries puts his
crooked horns under them. The tail of Scorpio shall
produce lightning, and Cancer quarrel with the Sun.
Virgo shall mount upon the back of Sagittarius, and
darken her virgin flowers. The chariot of the Moon
shall disorder the zodiac, and the Pleiades break forth
into weeping. No offices of Janus shall hereafter return,
but his gate being shut shall lie hid in the chinks of
Ariadne. The seas shall rise up in the twinkling of an
eye, and the dust of the ancients shall be restored. The
winds shall fight together with a dreadful blast, and their
sound shall reach the stars."</p>

<h3>BOOK VIII.</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. I.</span>&mdash;<i>Vortigern asks Merlin concerning his own death.</i></h3>


<p>Merlin, by delivering these and many other prophecies,
caused in all that were present an admiration at the ambiguity
of his expressions. But Vortigern above all the rest both
admired and applauded the wisdom, and prophetical spirit of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
the young man: for that age had produced none that ever
talked in such a manner before him. Being therefore curious
to learn his own fate, he desired the young man to tell him
what he knew concerning that particular. Merlin answered:&mdash;"Fly
the fire of the sons of Constantine, if you are able to
do it: already are they fitting out their ships: already are they
leaving the Armorican shore: already are they spreading out
their sails to the wind. They will steer towards Britain: they
will invade the Saxon nation: they will subdue that wicked
people; but they will first burn you being shut up in a tower.
To your own ruin did you prove a traitor to their father, and
invite the Saxons into the island. You invited them for your
safeguard; but they came for a punishment to you. Two
deaths instantly threaten you; nor is it easy to determine,
which you can best avoid. For on the one hand the Saxons
shall lay waste your country, and endeavour to kill you: on the
other shall arrive the two brothers, Aurelius Ambrosius and
Uther Pendragon, whose business will be to revenge their
father's murder upon you. Seek out some refuge if you can:
to-morrow they will be on the shore of Totness. The
faces of the Saxons shall look red with blood, Hengist shall
be killed, and Aurelius Ambrosius shall be crowned. He
shall bring peace to the nation; he shall restore the churches;
but shall die of poison. His brother Uther Pendragon shall
succeed him, whose days also shall be cut short by poison.
There shall be present at the commission of this treason your
own issue, whom the boar of Cornwall shall devour." Accordingly
the next day early, arrived Aurelius Ambrosius and
his brother, with ten thousand men.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. II.</span>&mdash;<i>Aurelius Ambrosius, being anointed king of Britain, burns
Vortigern besieged in a tower.</i></h3>


<p>As soon as the news of his coming was divulged, the Britons,
who had been dispersed by their great calamities, met together
from all parts, and gaining this new accession of strength
from their countrymen, displayed unusual vigour. Having
assembled together the clergy, they anointed Aurelius king,
and paid him the customary homage. And when the people
were urgent to fall upon the Saxons, he dissuaded them from
it, because his desire was to pursue Vortigern first. For the
treason committed against his father so very much affected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
him, that he thought nothing done till that was first avenged.
In pursuance therefore of this design, he marched with his
army into Cambria, to the town of Genoreu, whither Vortigern
had fled for refuge. That town was in the country of
Hergin, upon the river Gania, in the mountain called
Cloarius. As soon as Ambrosius was arrived there, bearing
in his mind the murder of his father and brother, he spake
thus to Eldol, duke of Gloucester.</p>

<p>"See, most noble duke, whether the walls of this city are
able to protect Vortigern against my sheathing this sword in
his bowels. He deserves to die, and you cannot, I suppose,
be ignorant of his desert. Oh most villainous of men, whose
crimes deserve inexpressible tortures! First he betrayed my
father Constantine, who had delivered him and his country
from the inroads of the Picts; afterwards my brother Constans
whom he made king on purpose to destroy him. Again,
when by his craft he had usurped the crown, he introduced
pagans among the natives, in order to abuse those who continued
stedfast in their loyalty to me: but by the good providence
of God, he unwarily fell into the snare, which he
had laid for my faithful subjects. For the Saxons, when
they found him out in his wickedness, drove him from the
kingdom; for which nobody ought to be concerned. But
this I think matter of just grief, that this odious people,
whom that detestable traitor invited over, has expelled the
nobility, laid waste a fruitful country, destroyed the holy
churches, and almost extinguished Christianity over the
whole kingdom. Now, therefore, my countrymen, show
yourselves men; first revenge yourselves upon him that was
the occasion of all these disasters; then let us turn our
arms against our enemies, and free our country from their
brutish tyranny."</p>

<p>Immediately, therefore, they set their engines to work,
and laboured to beat down the walls. But at last, when all
other attempts failed, they had recourse to fire, which meeting
with proper fuel ceased not to rage, till it had burned
down the tower and Vortigern in it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. III.</span>&mdash;<i>The praise of Aurelius's valour. The levity of the Scots
exposed. Forces raised against Hengist.</i></h3>


<p>Hengist, with his Saxons, was struck with terror at this
news, for he dreaded the valour of Aurelius. Such was the
bravery and courage this prince was master of, that while
he was in Gaul, there was none that durst encounter with
him. For in all encounters he either dismounted his adversary,
or broke his spear. Besides, he was magnificent in his
presents, constant at his devotions, temperate in all respects,
and above all things hated a lie. A brave soldier on foot, a
better on horseback, and expert in the discipline of an army.
Reports of these his noble accomplishments, while he yet
continued in Armorican Britain, were daily brought over into
the island. Therefore, the Saxons, for fear of him, retired
beyond the Humber, and in those parts fortified the cities
and towns; for that country always was a place of refuge to
them; their safety lying in the neighbourhood of Scotland,
which used to watch all opportunities of distressing the
nation; for that country being in itself a frightful place
to live in, and wholly uninhabited, had been a safe retreat
for strangers. By its situation it lay open to the Picts, Scots,
Dacians, Norwegians, and others, that came to plunder the
island. Being, therefore, secure of a safe reception in this
country, they fled towards it, that, if there should be occasion,
they might retreat into it as into their own camp. This
was good news to Aurelius, and made him conceive greater
hopes of victory. So assembling his people quickly together,
he augmented his army, and made an expeditious march
towards the north. In his passage through the countries,
he was grieved to see the desolation made in them, but
especially that the churches were levelled with the ground;
and he promised to rebuild them, if he gained the victory.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. IV.</span>&mdash;<i>Hengist marches with his army against Aurelius, into the
field of Maisbeli.</i></h3>


<p>But Hengist, upon his approach, took courage again, and
chose out the bravest of his men, whom he exhorted to make
a gallant defence, and not be daunted at Aurelius, who, he
told them, had but few Armorican Britons with him, since
their number did not exceed ten thousand. And as for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
native Britons, he made no account of them, since they had
been so often defeated by him. He therefore promised them
the victory, and that they should come off safely, considering
the superiority of their number, which amounted to two
hundred thousand men in arms. After he had in this manner
animated his men, he advanced with them towards Aurelius,
into a field called Maisbeli, through which Aurelius was to
pass. For his intention was to make a sudden assault by a
surprise, and fall upon the Britons before they were prepared.
But Aurelius perceived the design, and yet did not, on that
account, delay going to the field, but rather pursued his
march with more expedition. When he was come within
sight of the enemy, he put his troops in order, commanding
three thousand Armoricans to attend the cavalry, and drew
out the rest together with the islanders into line of battle.
The Dimetians he placed upon the hills, and the Venedotians
in the adjacent woods. His reason for which was,
that they might be there ready to fall upon the Saxons, in
case they should flee in that direction.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. V.</span>&mdash;<i>A battle between Aurelius and Hengist.</i></h3>


<p>In the meantime, Eldol, duke of Gloucester, went to the
king, and said, "This one day should suffice for all the days
of my life, if by good providence I could but get an opportunity
to engage with Hengist; for one of us should die
before we parted. I still retain deeply fixed in my memory
the day appointed for our peaceably treating together, but
which he villainously made use of to assassinate all that were
present at the treaty, except myself only, who stood upon my
defence with a stake which I accidentally found, until I made
my escape. That very day proved fatal, through his treachery,
to no less than four hundred and sixty barons and consuls,
who all went unarmed. From that conspiracy God was
pleased to deliver me, by throwing a stake in my way, wherewith
I defended myself and escaped." Thus spoke Eldol.
Then Aurelius exhorted his companions to place all their
hope in the Son of God, and to make a brave assault with
one consent upon the enemy, in defence of their country.
Nor was Hengist less busy on the other hand in forming his
troops, and giving them directions how to behave themselves
in the battle; and he walked himself through their several<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
ranks, the more to spirit them up. At last, both armies,
being drawn out in order of battle, began the attack, which
they maintained with great bravery, and no small loss of
blood, both to the Britons and Saxons. Aurelius animated
the Christians, Hengist the pagans; and all the time of the
engagement, Eldol's chief endeavour was to encounter Hengist,
but he had no opportunity for it. For Hengist, when
he found that his own men were routed, and that the Christians,
by the especial favour of God, had the advantage, fled
to the town called Kaerconan, now Cunungeburg. Aurelius
pursued him, and either killed or made slaves of all he found
in the way. When Hengist saw that he was pursued by
Aurelius, he would not enter the town, but assembled his
troops, and prepared them to stand another engagement.
For he knew the town would not hold out against Aurelius,
and that his whole security now lay in his sword. At last
Aurelius overtook him, and after marshalling his forces, began
another most furious fight. And here the Saxons
steadily maintained their ground, notwithstanding the numbers
that fell. On both sides there was a great slaughter,
the groans of the dying causing a greater rage in those that
survived. In short, the Saxons would have gained the day,
had not a detachment of horse from the Armorican Britons
come in upon them. For Aurelius had appointed them the
same station which they had in the former battle; so that,
upon their advancing, the Saxons gave ground, and when
once a little dispersed, were not able to rally again. The
Britons, encouraged by this advantage, exerted themselves,
and laboured with all their might to distress the
enemy. All the time Aurelius was fully employed, not only
in giving commands, but encouraging his men by his own
example; for with his own hand he killed all that stood in
his way, and pursued those that fled. Nor was Eldol less
active in all parts of the field, running to and fro to assault
his adversaries; but still his main endeavour was to find
opportunity of encountering Hengist.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. VI.</span>&mdash;<i>Hengist, in a duel with Eldol, is taken by him. The Saxons
are slain by the Britons without mercy.</i></h3>


<p>As there were therefore several movements made by the
parties engaged on each side, an opportunity occurred for their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
meeting, and briskly engaging each other. In this encounter
of the two greatest champions in the field, the fire sparkled
with the clashing of their arms, and every stroke in a manner
produced both thunder and lightning. For a long time was the
victory in suspense, as it seemed sometimes to favour the one,
sometimes the other. While they were thus hotly engaged,
Gorlois, duke of Cornwall, came up to them with the party he
commanded, and did great execution upon the enemies' troops.
At the sight of him, Eldol, assured of victory, seized on the
helmet of Hengist, and by main force dragged him in among
the Britons, and then in transports of joy cried out with a
loud voice, "God has fulfilled my desire! My brave soldiers,
down, down, with your enemies the Ambrons.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> The victory
is now in your hands: Hengist is defeated, and the day is
your own." In the meantime the Britons failed not to perform
every one his part against the pagans, upon whom they
made many vigorous assaults; and though they were obliged
sometimes to give ground, yet their courage did not fail them
in making a good resistance; so that they gave the enemy
no respite till they had vanquished them. The Saxons
therefore fled whithersoever their consternation hurried them,
some to the cities, some to the woods upon the hills, and
others to their ships. But Octa, the son of Hengist, made
his retreat with a great body of men to York: and Eosa,
his kinsman, to the city of Alclud, where he had a very large
army for his guard.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. VII.</span>&mdash;<i>Hengist is beheaded by Eldol.</i></h3>


<p>Aurelius, after this victory, took the city of Conan above-mentioned,
and stayed there three days. During this time
he gave orders for the burial of the slain, for curing the
wounded, and for the ease and refreshment of his forces that
were fatigued. Then he called a council of his principal
officers, to deliberate what was to be done with Hengist.
There was present at the assembly Eldad, bishop of Gloucester,
and brother of Eldol, a prelate of very great wisdom
and piety. As soon as he beheld Hengist standing in the
king's presence, he demanded silence, and said, "Though all
should be unanimous for setting him at liberty, yet would I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
cut him to pieces. The prophet Samuel is my warrant, who,
when he had Agag, king of Amalek, in his power, hewed
him in pieces, saying, As thy sword hath made women childless,
so shall thy mother be childless among women. Do
therefore the same to Hengist, who is a second Agag."
Accordingly Eldol took his sword, and drew him out of the
city, and then cut off his head. But Aurelius, who showed
moderation in all his conduct, commanded him to be buried,
and a heap of earth to be raised over his body, according to
the custom of the pagans.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. VIII.</span>&mdash;<i>Octa, being besieged in York, surrenders himself to the
mercy of Aurelius.</i></h3>


<p>From hence Aurelius conducted his army to York, to besiege
Octa, Hengist's son. When the city was invested, Octa was
doubtful whether he should give him any opposition, and
stand a siege against such a powerful army. After consultation
upon it, he went out with his principal nobility that were
present, carrying a chain in his hand, and sand upon his
head, and presented himself to the king with this address:
"My gods are vanquished, and I doubt not that the sovereign
power is in your God, who has compelled so many noble persons
to come before you in this suppliant manner. Be pleased
therefore to accept of us, and of this chain. If you do not
think us fit objects of your clemency, we here present ourselves
ready to be fettered, and to undergo whatever punishment
you shall adjudge us to." Aurelius was moved with
pity at the spectacle, and demanded the advice of his council
what should be done with them. After various proposals
upon this subject, Eldad the bishop rose up, and delivered
his opinion in these words: "The Gibeonites came voluntarily
to the children of Israel to desire mercy, and they
obtained it. And shall we Christians be worse than the
Jews, in refusing them mercy? It is mercy which they beg,
and let them have it. The island of Britain is large, and in
many places uninhabited. Let us make a covenant with
them, and suffer them at least to inhabit the desert places,
that they may be our vassals for ever." The king acquiesced
in Eldad's advice, and suffered them to partake of his clemency.
After this Eosa and the rest that fled, being encouraged by
Octa's success, came also, and were admitted to the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
favour. The king therefore granted them the country bordering
upon Scotland, and made a firm covenant with them.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. IX.</span>&mdash;<i>Aurelius, having entirely routed the enemies, restores all
things in Britain, especially ecclesiastical affairs, to their ancient state.</i></h3>


<p>The enemies being now entirely reduced,<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> the king summoned
the consuls and princes of the kingdom together at
York, where he gave orders for the restoration of the
churches, which the Saxons had destroyed. He himself
undertook the rebuilding of the metropolitan church of that
city, as also the other cathedral churches in that province.
After fifteen days, when he had settled workmen in several
places, he went to London, which city had not escaped the
fury of the enemy. He beheld with great sorrow the destruction
made in it, and recalled the remainder of the citizens
from all parts, and began the restoration of it. Here
he settled the affairs of the whole kingdom, revived the
laws, restored the right heirs to the possessions of their ancestors;
and those estates, whereof the heirs had been lost in
the late grievous calamity, he distributed among his fellow
soldiers. In these important concerns, of restoring the nation
to its ancient state, repairing the churches, re-establishing
peace and law, and settling the administration of justice,
was his time wholly employed. From hence he went to
Winchester, to repair the ruins of it, as he did of other
cities; and when the work was finished there, he went, at
the instance of bishop Eldad, to the monastery near Kaercaradoc,
now Salisbury, where the consuls and princes,
whom the wicked Hengist had treacherously murdered, lay
buried. At this place was a convent that maintained three
hundred friars, situated on the mountain of Ambrius, who,
as is reported, had been the founder of it. The sight of
the place where the dead lay, made the king, who was of a
compassionate temper, shed tears, and at last enter upon
thoughts, what kind of monument to erect upon it. For he
thought something ought to be done to perpetuate the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
memory of that piece of ground, which was honoured with
the bodies of so many noble patriots, that died for their
country.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. X.</span>&mdash;<i>Aurelius is advised by Merlin to remove the Giant's Dance
from the mountain Killaraus.</i></h3>


<p>For this purpose he summoned together several carpenters
and masons, and commanded them to employ the utmost of
their art, in contriving some new structure, for a lasting
monument to those great men. But they, in diffidence of
their own skill, refusing to undertake it, Tremounus, archbishop
of the City of Legions, went to the king, and said,
"If any one living is able to execute your commands, Merlin,
the prophet of Vortigern, is the man. In my opinion
there is not in all your kingdom a person of a brighter
genius, either in predicting future events, or in mechanical
contrivances. Order him to come to you, and exercise his
skill in the work which you design." Whereupon Aurelius,
after he had asked a great many questions concerning him,
despatched several messengers into the country to find him
out, and bring him to him. After passing through several
provinces, they found him in the country of the Gewisseans,
at the fountain of Galabes, which he frequently resorted to.
As soon as they had delivered their message to him, they
conducted him to the king, who received him with joy, and,
being curious to hear some of his wonderful speeches, commanded
him to prophesy. Merlin made answer: "Mysteries
of this kind are not to be revealed but when there is the
greatest necessity for it. If I should pretend to utter them
for ostentation or diversion, the spirit that instructs me
would be silent, and would leave me when I should have
occasion for it." When he had made the same refusal to all
the rest present, the king would not urge him any longer
about his predictions, but spoke to him concerning the monument
which he designed. "If you are desirous," said Merlin,
"to honour the burying-place of these men with an everlasting
monument, send for the Giant's Dance, which is in
Killaraus, a mountain in Ireland. For there is a structure
of stones there, which none of this age could raise, without
a profound knowledge of the mechanical arts. They are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
stones of a vast magnitude and wonderful quality; and if
they can be placed here, as they are there, round this spot of
ground, they will stand for ever."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XI.</span>&mdash;<i>Uther Pendragon is appointed with Merlin to bring over the
Giant's Dance.</i></h3>


<p>At these words of Merlin, Aurelius burst into laughter, and
said, "How is it possible to remove such vast stones from so
distant a country, as if Britain was not furnished with stones
fit for the work?" Merlin replied, "I entreat your majesty
to forbear vain laughter; for what I say is without vanity.
They are mystical stones, and of a medicinal virtue. The
giants of old brought them from the farthest coast of Africa,
and placed them in Ireland, while they inhabited that country.
Their design in this was to make baths in them, when
they should be taken with any illness. For their method
was to wash the stones, and put their sick into the water,
which infallibly cured them. With the like success they
cured wounds also, adding only the application of some
herbs. There is not a stone there which has not some healing
virtue." When the Britons heard this, they resolved to
send for the stones, and to make war upon the people of
Ireland if they should offer to detain them. And to accomplish
this business, they made choice of Uther Pendragon,
who was to be attended with fifteen thousand men. They
chose also Merlin himself, by whose direction the whole
affair was to be managed. A fleet being therefore got
ready, they set sail, and with a fair wind arrived in Ireland.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XII.</span>&mdash;<i>Gillomanius being routed by Uther, the Britons bring over
the Giant's dance into Britain.</i></h3>


<p>At that time Gillomanius, a youth of wonderful valour,
reigned in Ireland; who, upon the news of the arrival of
the Britons in his kingdom, levied a vast army, and marched
out against them. And when he had learned the occasion
of their coming, he smiled, and said to those about him,
"No wonder a cowardly race of people were able to make
so great a devastation in the island of Britain, when the
Britons are such brutes and fools. Was ever the like folly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
heard of? What are the stones of Ireland better than those
of Britain, that our kingdom must be put to this disturbance
for them? To arms, soldiers, and defend your country;
while I have life they shall not take from us the least stone
of the Giant's Dance." Uther, seeing them prepared for a
battle, attacked them; nor was it long ere the Britons had
the advantage, who, having dispersed and killed the Irish,
forced Gillomanius to flee. After the victory they went to
the mountain Killaraus, and arrived at the structure of stones,
the sight of which filled them both with joy and admiration.
And while they were all standing round them, Merlin came
up to them and said, "Now try your forces, young men, and
see whether strength or art can do the most towards taking
down these stones." At this word they all set to their
engines with one accord, and attempted the removing of the
Giant's Dance. Some prepared cables, others small ropes,
others ladders for the work, but all to no purpose. Merlin
laughed at their vain efforts, and then began his own contrivances.
When he had placed in order the engines that were
necessary, he took down the stones with an incredible facility,
and gave directions for carrying them to the ships, and
placing them therein. This done, they with joy set sail
again, to return to Britain; where they arrived with a fair
gale, and repaired to the burying-place with the stones.
When Aurelius had notice of it, he sent messengers to all
parts of Britain, to summon the clergy and people together
to the mount of Ambrius, in order to celebrate with joy and
honour the erection of the monument. Upon this summons
appeared the bishops, abbats, and people of all other orders and
qualities; and upon the day and place appointed for their
general meeting, Aurelius placed the crown upon his head,
and with royal pomp celebrated the feast of Pentecost, the
solemnity whereof he continued the three following days.
In the meantime, all places of honour that were vacant, he
bestowed upon his domestics as rewards for their good services.
At that time the two metropolitan sees of York and
Legions were vacant; and with the general consent of the
people, whom he was willing to please in this choice, he
granted York to Sanxo, a man of great quality, and much
celebrated for his piety; and the City of Legions to Dubricius,
whom divine providence had pointed out as a most use<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>ful
pastor in that place. As soon as he had settled these
and other affairs in the kingdom, he ordered Merlin to
set up the stones brought over from Ireland, about the
sepulchre; which he accordingly did, and placed them in
the same manner as they had been in the mountain Killaraus,
and thereby gave a manifest proof of the prevalence of art
above strength.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XIII.</span>&mdash;<i>Pascentius brings in the Saxons against the Britons.</i></h3>


<p>At the same time Pascentius, the son of Vortigern, who
had fled over into Germany, was levying all the forces of
that kingdom against Aurelius Ambrosius, with a design to
revenge his father's death; and promised his men an immense
treasure of gold and silver, if with their assistance he
could succeed in reducing Britain under his power. When
he had at last corrupted all the youth of the country with
his large promises, he prepared a vast fleet, and arrived in
the northern parts of the island, upon which he began to
make great devastations. The king, on the other hand,
hearing this news, assembled his army, and marching against
them challenged the enraged enemy to a battle; the challenge
was accepted, and by the blessing of God the enemy
was defeated and put to flight.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XIV.</span>&mdash;<i>Pascentius, assisted by the king of Ireland, again invades
Britain. Aurelius dies by the treachery of Eopa, a Saxon.</i></h3>


<p>Pascentius, after this flight, durst not return to Germany,
but shifting his sails, went over to Gillomanius, in Ireland,
by whom he was well received. And when he had given
him an account of his misfortune, Gillomanius, in pity to him,
promised him his assistance, and at the same time vented his
complaint of the injuries done him by Uther, the brother of
Aurelius, when he came for the Giant's Dance. At last,
entering into confederacy together, they made ready their
fleet, in which they embarked, and arrived at the city of
Menevia. This news caused Uther Pendragon to levy his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
forces, and march into Cambria to fight them. For his
brother Aurelius then lay sick at Winchester, and was not
able to go himself. When Pascentius, Gillomanius, and the
Saxons heard of it, they highly rejoiced, flattering themselves,
that his sickness would facilitate to them the conquest
of Britain. While this occurrence was the subject of the
people's discourse, one of the Saxons, named Eopa, came to
Pascentius, and said, "What reward will you give the man
that shall kill Aurelius Ambrosius for you?" To whom
Pascentius answered, "O that I could find a man of such
resolution! I would give him a thousand pounds of silver,
and my friendship for life; and if by good fortune I can but
gain the crown, I promise upon oath to make him a centurion."
To this Eopa replied, "I have learned the British
language, and know the manners of the people, and have skill
in physic. If, therefore, you will perform this promise, I
will pretend to be a Christian and a Briton, and when, as a
physician, I shall be admitted into the king's presence, I will
make him a potion that shall despatch him. And to gain the
readier access to him, I will put on the appearance of a devout
and learned monk." Upon this offer, Pascentius entered
into covenant with him, and confirmed what he had promised
with an oath. Eopa, therefore, shaved his beard and head, and
in the habit of a monk hastened to Winchester, loaded with
vessels full of medical preparations. As soon as he arrived
there, he offered his service to those that attended about the
king, and was graciously received by them; for to them
nobody was now more acceptable than a physician. Being
introduced into the king's presence, he promised to restore
him to his health, if he would but take his potions. Upon
which he had his orders forthwith to prepare one of them,
into which when he had secretly conveyed a poisonous mixture,
he gave it the king. As soon as Aurelius had drunk
it up, the wicked Ambron ordered him presently to cover
himself close up, and fall asleep, that the detestable potion
might the better operate. The king readily obeyed his prescriptions,
and in hopes of his speedy recovery fell asleep.
But the poison quickly diffused itself through all the pores
and veins of his body, so that the sleep ended in death. In
the meantime the wicked traitor, having cunningly withdrawn
himself first from one and then from another, was no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
longer to be found in the court. During these transactions
at Winchester, there appeared a star of wonderful magnitude
and brightness, darting forth a ray, at the end of which was
a globe of fire in form of a dragon, out of whose mouth
issued forth two rays; one of which seemed to stretch out
itself beyond the extent of Gaul, the other towards the Irish
Sea, and ended in seven lesser rays.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XV.</span>&mdash;<i>A comet presignifies the reign of Uther.</i></h3>


<p>At the appearance of this star, a general fear and amazement
seized the people; and even Uther, the king's brother,
who was then upon his march with his army into Cambria,
being not a little terrified at it, was very curious to know of
the learned men, what it portended. Among others, he
ordered Merlin to be called, who also attended in this expedition
to give his advice in the management of the war; and
who, being now presented before him, was commanded to
discover to him the signification of the star. At this he
burst out into tears, and with a loud voice cried out, "O
irreparable loss! O distressed people of Britain! Alas!
the illustrious prince is departed! The renowned king of
the Britons, Aurelius Ambrosius, is dead! whose death will
prove fatal to us all, unless God be our helper. Make haste,
therefore, most noble Uther, make haste to engage the enemy:
the victory will be yours, and you shall be king of all Britain.
For the star, and the fiery dragon under it, signifies yourself,
and the ray extending towards the Gallic coast, portends that
you shall have a most potent son, to whose power all those
kingdoms shall be subject over which the ray reaches. But
the other ray signifies a daughter, whose sons and grandsons
shall successively enjoy the kingdom of Britain."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XVI.</span>&mdash;<i>Pascentius and Gillomanius are killed in battle.</i></h3>


<p>Uther, though he doubted of the truth of what Merlin had
declared, pursued his march against the enemy, for he was
now come within half a day's march of Menevia. When Gillomanius,
Pascentius, and the Saxons were informed of his
approach, they went out to give him battle. As soon as
they were come within sight of each other, both armies began
to form themselves into several bodies, and then advanced to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
a close attack, in which both sides suffered a loss of men, as
usually happens in such engagements. At last, towards the
close of the day, the advantage was on Uther's side, and the
death of Gillomanius and Pascentius made a way for complete
victory. So that the barbarians, being put to flight,
hastened to their ships, but were slain by their pursuers.
Thus, by the favour of Christ, the general had triumphant
success, and then with all possible expedition, after so great
a fatigue, returned back to Winchester: for he had now
been informed, by messengers that arrived, of the king's sad
fate, and of his burial by the bishops of the country, near
the convent of Ambrius, within the Giant's Dance, which
in his lifetime he had commanded to be made. For upon
hearing the news of his death, the bishops, abbats, and all
the clergy of that province, had met together at Winchester,
to solemnize his funeral. And because in his lifetime he
had given orders for his being buried in the sepulchre which
he had prepared, they therefore carried his corpse thither,
and performed his exsequies with royal magnificence.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XVII.</span>&mdash;<i>Uther Pendragon is made king of Britain.</i></h3>


<p>But Uther his brother, having assembled the clergy of the
kingdom, took the crown, and by universal consent was
advanced to the kingdom. And remembering the explanation
which Merlin had made of the star above-mentioned,
he commanded two dragons to be made of gold, in likeness
of the dragon which he had seen at the ray of the star. As
soon as they were finished, which was done with wonderful
nicety of workmanship, he made a present of one to the
cathedral church of Winchester, but reserved the other for
himself, to be carried along with him to his wars. From
this time, therefore, he was called Uther Pendragon, which
in the British tongue signifies the dragon's head; the occasion
of this appellation being Merlin's predicting, from the
appearance of a dragon, that he should be king.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XVIII.</span>&mdash;<i>Octa and Eosa are taken in battle.</i></h3>


<p>In the meantime Octa the son of Hengist, and his kinsman
Eosa, seeing they were no longer bound by the treaty which
they had made with Aurelius Ambrosius, began to raise dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>turbances
against the king, and infest his countries. For
they were now joining with the Saxons whom Pascentius
had brought over, and sending messengers into Germany for
the rest. Being therefore attended with a vast army, he invaded
the northern provinces, and in an outrageous manner
destroyed all the cities and fortified places, from Albania to
York. At last, as he was beginning the siege of that city,
Uther Pendragon came upon him with the whole power of
the kingdom, and gave him battle. The Saxons behaved
with great gallantry, and, having sustained the assaults of
the Britons, forced them to fly; and upon this advantage
pursued them with slaughter to the mountain Damen, which
was as long as they could do it with daylight. The mountain
was high, and had a hazel-wood upon the top of it, and
about the middle broken and cavernous rocks, which were a
harbour to wild beasts. The Britons made up to it, and
stayed there all night among the rocks and hazel-bushes.
But as it began to draw towards day, Uther commanded the
consuls and princes to be called together, that he might consult
with them in what manner to assault the enemy. Whereupon
they forthwith appeared before the king, who commanded
them to give their advice; and Gorlois, duke of
Cornwall, had orders to deliver his opinion first, out of regard
to his years and great experience. "There is no occasion,"
said he, "for ceremonies or speeches, while we see that it is
still night: but there is for boldness and courage, if you
desire any longer enjoyment of your life and liberty. The
pagans are very numerous, and eager to fight, and we much
inferior to them in number; so that if we stay till daybreak,
we cannot, in my opinion, attack them to advantage. Come
on, therefore, while we have the favour of the night, let us
go down in a close body, and surprise them in their camp
with a sudden assault. There can be no doubt of success,
if with one consent we fall upon them boldly, while they
think themselves secure, and have no expectation of our
coming in such a manner." The king and all that were present,
were pleased with his advice, and pursued it. For as
soon as they were armed and placed in their ranks, they
made towards the enemies' camp, designing a general assault.
But upon approaching to it, they were discovered by the
watch, who with sound of trumpet awaked their companions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
The enemies being hereupon put into confusion and astonishment,
part of them hastened towards the sea, and part ran
up and down whithersoever their fear or precipitation drove
them. The Britons, finding their coming discovered, hastened
their march, and keeping still close together in their ranks,
assailed the camp; into which when they had found an entrance,
they ran with their drawn swords upon the enemy;
who in this sudden surprise made but a faint defence against
their vigorous and regular attack; and pursuing this blow
with great eagerness they destroyed some thousands of the
pagans, took Octa and Eosa prisoners, and entirely dispersed
the Saxons.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XIX.</span>&mdash;<i>Uther, falling in love with Igerna, enjoys her by the assistance

<p>After this victory Uther repaired to the city of Alclud,
where he settled the affairs of that province, and restored
peace everywhere. He also made a progress round all the
countries of the Scots, and tamed the fierceness of that rebellious
people, by such a strict administration of justice, as
none of his predecessors had exercised before: so that in
his time offenders were everywhere under great terror, since
they were sure of being punished without mercy. At last,
when he had established peace in the northern provinces, he
went to London, and commanded Octa and Eosa to be kept
in prison there. The Easter following he ordered all the
nobility of the kingdom to meet at that city, in order to
celebrate that great festival; in honour of which he designed
to wear his crown. The summons was everywhere obeyed,
and there was a great concourse from all cities to celebrate
the day. So the king observed the festival with great
solemnity, as he had designed, and very joyfully entertained
his nobility, of whom there was a very great muster, with
their wives and daughters, suitably to the magnificence of
the banquet prepared for them. And having been received
with joy by the king, they also expressed the same in
their deportment before him. Among the rest was present
Gorlois, duke of Cornwall, with his wife Igerna, the
greatest beauty in all Britain. No sooner had the king cast
his eyes upon her among the rest of the ladies, than he fell
passionately in love with her, and little regarding the rest,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
made her the subject of all his thoughts. She was the only
lady that he continually served with fresh dishes, and to
whom he sent golden cups by his confidants; on her he
bestowed all his smiles, and to her addressed all his discourse.
The husband, discovering this, fell into a great
rage, and retired from the court without taking leave: nor
was there any body that could stop him, while he was under
fear of losing the chief object of his delight. Uther, therefore,
in great wrath commanded him to return back to court,
to make him satisfaction for this affront. But Gorlois
refused to obey; upon which the king was highly incensed,
and swore he would destroy his country, if he did not
speedily compound for his offence. Accordingly, without
delay, while their anger was hot against each other, the king
got together a great army, and marched into Cornwall, the
cities and towns whereof he set on fire. But Gorlois durst
not engage with him, on account of the inferiority of his
numbers; and thought it a wiser course to fortify his towns,
till he could get succour from Ireland. And as he was under
more concern for his wife than himself, he put her into the
town of Tintagel,<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> upon the sea-shore, which he looked
upon as a place of great safety. But he himself entered the
castle of Dimilioc, to prevent their being both at once involved
in the same danger, if any should happen. The king,
informed of this, went to the town where Gorlois was, which
he besieged, and shut up all the avenues to it. A whole
week was now past, when, retaining in mind his love to
Igerna, he said to one of his confidants, named Ulfin de
Ricaradoch: "My passion for Igerna is such, that I can
neither have ease of mind, nor health of body, till I obtain
her: and if you cannot assist me with your advice how to
accomplish my desire, the inward torments I endure will kill
me."&mdash;"Who can advise you in this matter," said Ulfin,
"when no force will enable us to have access to her in the
town of Tintagel? For it is situated upon the sea, and on
every side surrounded by it; and there is but one entrance
into it, and that through a straight rock, which three men
shall be able to defend against the whole power of the kingdom.
Notwithstanding, if the prophet Merlin would in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
earnest set about this attempt, I am of opinion, you might
with his advice obtain your wishes." The king readily believed
what he was so well inclined to, and ordered Merlin,
who was also come to the siege, to be called. Merlin, therefore,
being introduced into the king's presence, was commanded
to give his advice, how the king might accomplish
his desire with respect to Igerna. And he, finding the great
anguish of the king, was moved by such excessive love, and
said, "To accomplish your desire, you must make use of
such arts as have not been heard of in your time. I know
how, by the force of my medicines, to give you the exact
likeness of Gorlois, so that in all respects you shall seem to
be no other than himself. If you will therefore obey my
prescriptions, I will metamorphose you into the true semblance
of Gorlois and Ulfin into Jordan of Tintagel, his
familiar friend; and I myself, being transformed into another
shape, will make the third in the adventure; and in this
disguise you may go safely to the town where Igerna is, and
have admittance to her." The king complied with the proposal,
and acted with great caution in this affair; and when
he had committed the care of the siege to his intimate
friends, underwent the medical applications of Merlin, by
whom he was transformed into the likeness of Gorlois; as
was Ulfin also into Jordan, and Merlin himself into Bricel;
so that nobody could see any remains now of their former
likeness. They then set forward on their way to Tintagel,
at which they arrived in the evening twilight, and forthwith
signified to the porter, that the consul was come; upon which
the gates were opened, and the men let in. For what room
could there be for suspicion, when Gorlois himself seemed to
be there present? The king therefore stayed that night with
Igerna, and had the full enjoyment of her, for she was deceived
with the false disguise which he had put on, and the
artful and amorous discourses wherewith he entertained her.
He told her he had left his own place besieged, purely to
provide for the safety of her dear self, and the town she was
in; so that believing all that he said, she refused him nothing
which he desired. The same night therefore she conceived
of the most renowned Arthur, whose heroic and wonderful
actions have justly rendered his name famous to posterity.</p>

<p>In the meantime, as soon as the king's absence was discovered
at the siege, his army unadvisedly made an assault upon the
walls, and provoked the besieged count to a battle; who
himself also, acting as inconsiderately as they, sallied forth
with his men, thinking with such a small handful to oppose
a powerful army; but happened to be killed in the very first
brunt of the fight, and had all his men routed. The town
also was taken; but all the riches of it were not shared
equally among the besiegers, but every one greedily took
what he could get, according as fortune or his own strength
favoured him. After this bold attempt, came messengers to
Igerna, with the news both of the duke's death, and of the
event of the siege. But when they saw the king in the
likeness of the consul, sitting close by her, they were struck
with shame and astonishment at his safe arrival there, whom
they had left dead at the siege; for they were wholly
ignorant of the miracles which Merlin had wrought with his
medicines. The king therefore smiled at the news, and embracing
the countess, said to her: "Your own eyes may
convince you that I am not dead, but alive. But notwithstanding,
the destruction of the town, and the slaughter of
my men, is what very much grieves me; so that there is
reason to fear the king's coming upon us, and taking us in
this place. To prevent which, I will go out to meet him,
and make my peace with him, for fear of a worse disaster."
Accordingly, as soon as he was out of the town, he went to
his army, and having put off the disguise of Gorlois, was
now Uther Pendragon again. When he had a full relation
made to him how matters had succeeded, he was sorry for
the death of Gorlois, but rejoiced that Igerna was now at
liberty to marry again. Then he returned to the town of
Tintagel, which he took, and in it, what he impatiently
wished for, Igerna herself. After this they continued to
live together with much affection for each other, and had a
son and daughter, whose names were Arthur and Anne.</p>

<p>In process of time the king was taken ill of a lingering
distemper; and meanwhile the keepers of the prison,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
wherein Octa and Eosa (as we related before) led a weary
life, had fled over with them into Germany, and occasioned
great fear over the kingdom. For there was a report of their
great levies in Germany, and the vast fleet which they had
prepared for their return to destroy the island: which the
event verified. For they returned in a great fleet, and with
a prodigious number of men, and invaded the parts of
Albania, where they destroyed both cities and inhabitants
with fire and sword. Wherefore, in order to repulse the
enemies, the command of the British army was committed to
Lot of Londonesia, who was a consul, and a most valiant
knight, and grown up to maturity both of years and wisdom.
Out of respect to his eminent merits, the king had given him
his daughter Anne, and entrusted him with the care of the
kingdom, during his illness. In his expedition against the
enemies he had various success, being often repulsed by
them, and forced to retreat to the cities; but he oftener
routed and dispersed them, and compelled them to flee
sometimes into the woods, sometimes to their ships. So
that in a war attended with so many turns of fortune, it
was hard to know which side had the better. The greatest
injury to the Britons was their own pride, in disdaining
to obey the consul's commands; for which reason all
their efforts against the enemy were less vigorous and
successful.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XXII.</span>&mdash;<i>Uther, being ill, is carried in a horse-litter against the
enemy.</i></h3>


<p>The island being by this conduct now almost laid waste, the
king, having information of the matter, fell into a greater
rage than his weakness could bear, and commanded all his
nobility to come before him, that he might reprove them
severely for their pride and cowardice. And as soon as they
were all entered into his presence, he sharply rebuked them
in menacing language, and swore he himself would lead them
against the enemy. For this purpose he ordered a horse-litter
to be made, in which he designed to be carried, for his
infirmity would not suffer him to use any other sort of
vehicle; and he charged them to be all ready to march
against the enemy on the first opportunity. So, without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
delay, the horse-litter and all his attendants were got ready,
and the day arrived which had been appointed for their
march.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XXIII.</span>&mdash;<i>Octa and Eosa, with a great number of their men, are

<p>The king, therefore, being put into his vehicle, they marched
directly to Verulam, where the Saxons were grievously
oppressing the people. When Octa and Eosa had intelligence
that the Britons were come, and that the king was brought
in a horse-litter, they disdained to fight with him, saying, it
would be a shame for such brave men to fight with one that
was half dead. For which reason they retired into the city,
and, as it were in contempt of any danger from the enemy,
left their gates wide open. But Uther, upon information
of this, instantly commanded his men to lay siege to the city,
and assault the walls on all sides; which orders they strictly
executed; and were just entering the breaches which they
had made in the walls, and ready to begin a general assault,
when the Saxons, seeing the advantages which the Britons
had gained, and being forced to abate somewhat of their
haughty pride, condescended so far as to put themselves into
a posture of defence. They therefore mounted the walls,
from whence they poured down showers of arrows, and
repulsed the Britons. On both sides the contest continued
till night released them from the fatigue of their arms, which
was what many of the Britons desired, though the greater
part of them were for having the matter quickly decided
with the enemy. The Saxons, on the other hand, finding
how prejudicial their own pride had been to them, and that
the advantage was on the side of the Britons, resolved to
make a sally at break of day, and try their fortune with the
enemy in the open field; which accordingly was done. For
no sooner was it daylight, than they marched out with this
design, all in their proper ranks. The Britons, seeing them,
divided their men into several bodies, and advancing towards
them, began the attack first, their part being to assault, while
the others were only upon the defensive. However, much
blood was shed on both sides, and the greatest part of the
day spent in the fight, when at last, Octa and Eosa being
killed, the Saxons turned their backs, and left the Britons a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
complete victory. The king at this was in such an ecstasy
of joy, that whereas before he could hardly raise up himself
without the help of others, he now without any difficulty sat
upright in his horse-litter of himself, as if he was on a sudden
restored to health; and said with a laughing and merry
countenance, "These Ambrons called me the half-dead king,
because my sickness obliged me to lie on a horse-litter; and
indeed so I was. Yet victory to me half dead, is better than
to be safe and sound and vanquished. For to die with
honour, is preferable to living with disgrace."</p>

poisoned by the Saxons, dies.</i></h3>


<p>The Saxons, notwithstanding this defeat, persisted still in
their malice, and entering the northern provinces, without
respite infested the people there. Uther's purpose was to
have pursued them; but his princes dissuaded him from it
because his illness had increased since the victory. This
gave new courage to the enemy, who left nothing unattempted
to make conquest of the kingdom. And now they have
recourse to their former treacherous practices, and contrive
how to compass the king's death by secret villainy. And
because they could have no access to him otherwise, they
resolved to take him off by poison; in which they succeeded.
For while he was lying ill at Verulam, they sent away some
spies in a poor habit, to learn the state of the court; and
when they had thoroughly informed themselves of the
posture of affairs, they found out an expedient by which
they might best accomplish their villainy. For there was
near the court a spring of very clear water, which the king
used to drink of, when his distemper had made all other
liquors nauseous to him. This the detestable conspirators
made use of to destroy him, by so poisoning the whole mass
of water which sprang up, that the next time the king drank
of it, he was seized with sudden death, as were also a hundred
other persons after him, till the villainy was discovered, and a
heap of earth thrown over the well. As soon as the king's
death was divulged, the bishops and clergy of the kingdom
assembled, and carried his body to the convent of Ambrius,
where they buried it with regal solemnity, close by Aurelius
Ambrosius, within the Giant's Dance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<h3>BOOK IX.</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. I.</span>&mdash;<i>Arthur succeeds Uther his father in the kingdom of Britain,
and besieges Colgrin.</i></h3>


<p>Uther Pendragon being dead, the nobility from several
provinces assembled together at Silchester, and proposed to
Dubricius, archbishop of Legions, that he should consecrate
Arthur, Uther's son, to be their king. For they were now
in great straits, because, upon hearing of the king's death,
the Saxons had invited over their countrymen from Germany,
and, under the command of Colgrin, were attempting to exterminate
the whole British race. They had also entirely
subdued all that part of the island which extends from the
Humber to the sea of Caithness. Dubricius, therefore,
grieving for the calamities of his country, in conjunction
with the other bishops, set the crown upon Arthur's head.
Arthur was then fifteen years old, but a youth of such
unparalleled courage and generosity, joined with that sweetness
of temper and innate goodness, as gained him universal
love. When his coronation was over, he, according to usual
custom, showed his bounty and munificence to the people.
And such a number of soldiers flocked to him upon it, that
his treasury was not able to answer that vast expense. But
such a spirit of generosity, joined with valour, can never long
want means to support itself. Arthur, therefore, the better
to keep up his munificence, resolved to make use of his
courage, and to fall upon the Saxons, that he might enrich
his followers with their wealth. To this he was also moved
by the justice of the cause, since the entire monarchy of
Britain belonged to him by hereditary right. Hereupon
assembling the youth under his command, he marched to
York, of which, when Colgrin had intelligence, he met him
with a very great army, composed of Saxons, Scots, and
Picts, by the river Duglas; where a battle happened, with
the loss of the greater part of both armies. Notwithstanding,
the victory fell to Arthur, who pursued Colgrin to York, and
there besieged him. Baldulph, upon the news of his brother's
flight, went towards the siege with a body of six thousand
men, to his relief; for at the time of the battle he was upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
the sea-coast, waiting the arrival of duke Cheldric with
succours from Germany. And being now no more than ten
miles distant from the city, his purpose was to make a speedy
march in the night-time, and fall upon the enemy by way of
surprise. But Arthur, having intelligence of his design, sent
a detachment of six hundred horse, and three thousand foot,
under the command of Cador, duke of Cornwall, to meet him
the same night. Cador, therefore, falling into the same road
along which the enemy was passing, made a sudden assault
upon them, and entirely defeated the Saxons, and put them
to flight. Baldulph was excessively grieved at this disappointment
in the relief which he intended for his brother,
and began to think of some other stratagem to gain access to
him; in which if he could but succeed, he thought they
might concert measures together for their safety. And since
he had no other way for it, he shaved his head and beard,
and put on the habit of a jester with a harp, and in this
disguise walked up and down in the camp, playing upon his
instrument as if he had been a harper. He thus passed
unsuspected, and by a little and little went up to the walls
of the city, where he was at last discovered by the besieged,
who thereupon drew him up with cords, and conducted him
to his brother. At this unexpected, though much desired
meeting, they spent some time in joyfully embracing each
other, and then began to consider various stratagems for
their delivery. At last, just as they were considering their
case desperate, the ambassadors returned from Germany, and
brought with them to Albania a fleet of six hundred sail,
laden with brave soldiers, under the command of Cheldric.
Upon this news, Arthur was dissuaded by his council from
continuing the siege any longer, for fear of hazarding a battle
with so powerful and numerous an army.</p>

<p>Arthur complied with their advice, and made his retreat to
London, where he called an assembly of all the clergy and
nobility of the kingdom, to ask their advice, what course to
take against the formidable power of the pagans. After
some deliberation, it was agreed that ambassadors should be
despatched into Armorica, to king Hoel, to represent to him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>

sister by Dubricius, king of the Armorican Britons; so that,
upon advice of the disturbances his uncle was threatened
with, he ordered his fleet to be got ready, and, having
assembled fifteen thousand men, he arrived with the first
fair wind at Hamo's Port,<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> and was received with all suitable

by him.</p>

<p>After a few days they went to relieve the city Kaerlindcoit,
that was besieged by the pagans; which being situated upon
a mountain, between two rivers in the province of Lindisia,
is called by another name Lindocolinum.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> As soon as they
arrived there with all their forces, they fought with the
Saxons, and made a grievous slaughter of them, to the number
of six thousand; part of whom were drowned in the
rivers, part fell by the hands of the Britons. The rest in a
great consternation quitted the siege and fled, but were
closely pursued by Arthur, till they came to the wood of
Celidon, where they endeavoured to form themselves into a
body again, and make a stand. And here they again joined
battle with the Britons, and made a brave defence, whilst
the trees that were in the place secured them against the
enemies' arrows. Arthur, seeing this, commanded the trees
that were in that part of the wood to be cut down, and the
trunks to be placed quite round them, so as to hinder their
getting out; resolving to keep them pent up here till he
could reduce them by famine. He then commanded his
troops to besiege the wood, and continued three days in that
place. The Saxons, having now no provisions to sustain
them, and being just ready to starve with hunger, begged
for leave to go out; in consideration whereof they offered to
leave all their gold and silver behind them, and return back
to Germany with nothing but their empty ships. They promised
also that they would pay him tribute from Germany,
and leave hostages with him. Arthur, after consultation,
about it, granted their petition; allowing them only leave to
depart, and retaining all their treasures, as also hostages for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
payment of the tribute. But as they were under sail on
their return home, they repented of their bargain, and
tacked about again towards Britain, and went on shore at
Totness. No sooner were they landed, than they made an
utter devastation of the country as far as the Severn sea,
and put all the peasants to the sword. From thence they
pursued their furious march to the town of Bath, and laid
siege to it. When the king had intelligence of it, he was
beyond measure surprised at their proceedings, and immediately
gave orders for the execution of the hostages. And
desisting from an attempt which he had entered upon to reduce
the Scots and Picts, he marched with the utmost expedition
to raise the siege; but laboured under very great
difficulties, because he had left his nephew Hoel sick at
Alclud. At length, having entered the province of Somerset,
and beheld how the siege was carried on, he addressed himself
to his followers in these words: "Since these impious
and detestable Saxons have disdained to keep faith with me,
I, to keep faith with God, will endeavour to revenge the
blood of my countrymen this day upon them. To arms,
soldiers, to arms, and courageously fall upon the perfidious
wretches, over whom we shall, with Christ assisting us, undoubtedly
obtain the victory."</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. IV.</span>&mdash;<i>Dubricius's speech against the treacherous Saxons. Arthur
with his own hand kills four hundred and seventy Saxons in one battle. Colgrin and Baldulph are killed in the same.</i></h3>


<p>When he had done speaking, St. Dubricius, archbishop of
Legions, going to the top of a hill, cried out with a loud
voice, "You that have the honour to profess the Christian
faith, keep fixed in your minds the love which you owe to
your country and fellow subjects, whose sufferings by the
treachery of the pagans will be an everlasting reproach to
you, if you do not courageously defend them. It is your
country which you fight for, and for which you should, when
required, voluntarily suffer death; for that itself is victory
and the cure of the soul. For he that shall die for his brethren,
offers himself a living sacrifice to God, and has Christ
for his example, who condescended to lay down his life for
his brethren. If therefore any of you shall be killed in
this war, that death itself, which is suffered in so glorious a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
cause, shall be to him for penance and absolution of all his
sins." At these words, all of them, encouraged with the
benediction of the holy prelate, instantly armed themselves,
and prepared to obey his orders. Also Arthur himself, having
put on a coat of mail suitable to the grandeur of so
powerful a king, placed a golden helmet upon his head, on
which was engraven the figure of a dragon; and on his
shoulders his shield called Priwen; upon which the picture
of the blessed Mary, mother of God, was painted, in order
to put him frequently in mind of her. Then girding on his
Caliburn, which was an excellent sword made in the isle of
Avallon, he graced his right hand with his lance, named
Ron, which was hard, broad, and fit for slaughter. After
this, having placed his men in order, he boldly attacked the
Saxons, who were drawn out in the shape of a wedge, as
their manner was. And they, notwithstanding that the
Britons fought with great eagerness, made a noble defence
all that day; but at length, towards sunsetting, climbed up
the next mountain, which served them for a camp: for they
desired no larger extent of ground, since they confided very
much in their numbers. The next morning Arthur, with
his army, went up the mountain, but lost many of his men
in the ascent, by the advantage which the Saxons had in
their station on the top, from whence they could pour down
upon him with much greater speed, than he was able to advance
against them. Notwithstanding, after a very hard
struggle, the Britons gained the summit of the hill, and
quickly came to a close engagement with the enemy, who
again gave them a warm reception, and made a vigorous defence.
In this manner was a great part of that day also
spent; whereupon Arthur, provoked to see the little advantage
he had yet gained, and that victory still continued in
suspense, drew out his Caliburn, and, calling upon the name
of the blessed Virgin, rushed forward with great fury into
the thickest of the enemy's ranks; of whom (such was the
merit of his prayers) not one escaped alive that felt the fury
of his sword; neither did he give over the fury of his
assault until he had, with his Caliburn alone, killed four
hundred and seventy men. The Britons, seeing this, followed
their leader in great multitudes, and made slaughter
on all sides; so that Colgrin, and Baldulph his brother, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
many thousands more, fell before them. But Cheldric, in
this imminent danger of his men, betook himself to flight.</p>

compelled by Cador to surrender.</i></h3>


<p>The victory being thus gained, the king commanded Cador,
duke of Cornwall, to pursue them, while he himself should
hasten his march into Albania: from whence he had advice
that the Scots and Picts were besieging Alclud, in which, as
we said before, Hoel lay sick. Therefore he hastened to his
assistance, for fear he might fall into the hands of the barbarians.
In the meantime the duke of Cornwall, who had
the command of ten thousand men, would not as yet pursue
the Saxons in their flight, but speedily made himself master
of their ships, to hinder their getting on board, and manned
them with his best soldiers, who were to beat back the
pagans in case they should flee thither: after this he hastily
pursued the enemy, according to Arthur's command, and
allowed no quarter to those he could overtake. So that they
whose behaviour before was so cruel and insolent, now with
timorous hearts fled for shelter, sometimes to the coverts of
the woods, sometimes to mountains and caves, to prolong a
wretched life. At last, when none of these places could
afford them a safe retreat, they entered the Isle of Thanet with
their broken forces; but neither did they there get free from
the duke of Cornwall's pursuit, for he still continued slaughtering
them, and gave them no respite till he had killed
Cheldric, and taken hostages for the surrender of the
rest.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. VI.</span>&mdash;<i>Arthur grants a pardon to the Scots and Picts, besieged at
the Lake Lumond.</i></h3>


<p>Having therefore settled peace here, he directed his march
to Alclud, which Arthur had relieved from the oppression of
barbarians, and from thence conducted his army to Mureif,
where the Scots and Picts were besieged; after three several
battles with the king and his nephew, they had fled as far as
this province, and entering upon the lake Lumond, sought
for refuge in the islands that are upon it. This lake contains
sixty islands, and receives sixty rivers into it which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
empty themselves into the sea by no more than one mouth.
There is also an equal number of rocks in these islands, as
also of eagles' nests in those rocks, which flocked together
there every year, and, by the loud and general noise which
they now made, foreboded some remarkable event that should
happen to the kingdom. To these islands, therefore, had
the enemy fled, thinking the lake would serve them instead
of a fortification; but it proved of little advantage to them.
For Arthur, having got together a fleet, sailed round the
rivers, and besieged the enemy fifteen days together, by which
they were so straitened with hunger, that they died by thousands.
While he was harassing them in this manner Guillamurius,
king of Ireland, came up in a fleet with a very
great army of barbarians, in order to relieve the besieged.
This obliged Arthur to raise the siege, and turn his arms
against the Irish, whom he slew without mercy, and compelled
the rest to return back to their country. After this
victory, he proceeded in his first attempt, which was to
extirpate the whole race of the Scots and Picts, and treated
them with an unparalleled severity. And as he allowed
quarter to none, the bishops of that miserable country, with
all the inferior clergy, met together, and bearing the reliques
of the saints and other consecrated things of the church
before them, barefooted, came to implore the king's mercy
for their people. As soon as they were admitted into his
presence, they fell down upon their knees, and humbly besought
him to have pity on their distressed country, since
the sufferings which he had already made it undergo were
sufficient; nor was there any necessity to cut off the small
remainder to a man; and that he would allow them the
enjoyment of a small part of the country, since they were
willing to bear the yoke which he should impose upon them.
The king was moved at the manner of their delivering this
petition, and could not forbear expressing his clemency to
them with tears; and at the request of those holy men,
granted them pardon.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. VII.</span>&mdash;<i>Arthur relates the wonderful nature of some ponds.</i></h3>


<p>This affair being concluded, Hoel had the curiosity to view
the situation of the lake, and wondered to find the number
of the rivers, islands, rocks, and eagles' nests, so exactly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
correspond: and while he was reflecting upon it as something
that appeared miraculous, Arthur came to him, and
told him of another pond in the same province, which was
yet more wonderful. For not far from thence was one whose
length and breadth were each twenty feet, and depth five
feet. But whether its square figure was natural or artificial,
the wonder of it was, there were four different sorts of
fishes in the four several corners of it, none of which were
ever found in any other part of the pond but their own. He
told him likewise of another pond in Wales, near the Severn,
called by the country people Linligwan, into which when the
sea flows, it receives it in the manner of a gulf, but so as to
swallow up the tide, and never be filled, or have its banks
covered by it. But at the ebbing of the sea, it throws out
the waters which it had swallowed, as high as a mountain,
and at last dashes and covers the banks with them. In the
meantime, if all the people of that country should stand near
with their faces towards it, and happened to have their clothes
sprinkled with the dashing of the waves, they would hardly,
if at all, escape being swallowed up by the pond. But with
their backs towards it, they need not fear being dashed,
though they stood upon the very banks.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. VIII.</span>&mdash;<i>Arthur restores York to its ancient beauty, especially as to
its churches.</i></h3>


<p>The king, after his general pardon granted to the Scots, went
to York to celebrate the feast of Christ's nativity, which was
now at hand. On entering the city, he beheld with grief
the desolation of the churches; for upon the expulsion of
the holy Archbishop Sanxo, and of all the clergy there,
the temples which were half burned down, had no longer
divine service performed in them: so much had the impious
rage of the pagans prevailed. After this, in an assembly of
the clergy and people, he appointed Pyramus his chaplain
metropolitan of that see. The churches that lay level with
the ground, he rebuilt, and (which was their chief ornament)
saw them filled with assemblies of devout persons of both
sexes. Also the nobility that were driven out by the disturbances
of the Saxons, he restored to their country.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. IX.</span>&mdash;<i>Arthur honours Augusel with the sceptre of the Scots; Urian
with that of Mureif; and Lot with the consulship of Londonesia.</i></h3>


<p>There were there three brothers of royal blood, viz. Lot,
Urian, and Augusel, who, before the Saxons had prevailed,
held the government of those parts. Being willing therefore
to bestow on these, as he did on others, the rights of their
ancestors, he restored to Augusel the sovereignty over the
Scots; his brother Urian he honoured with the sceptre of
Mureif; and Lot, who in time of Aurelius Ambrosius had
married his sister, by whom he had two sons, Walgan and
Modred, he re-established in the consulship of Londonesia,
and the other provinces belonging to him. At length, when
the whole country was reduced by him to its ancient state,
he took to wife Guanhumara, descended from a noble family
of Romans, who was educated under duke Cador, and in
beauty surpassed all the women of the island.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. X.</span>&mdash;<i>Arthur adds to his government Ireland, Iceland, Gothland,
and the Orkneys.</i></h3>


<p>The next summer he fitted out a fleet, and made an expedition
into Ireland, which he was desirous to reduce. Upon
landing there, he was met by king Guillamurius before mentioned,
with a vast number of men, who came with a design
to fight him; but at the very beginning of the battle, those
naked and unarmed people were miserably routed, and fled
to such places as lay open to them for shelter. Guillamurius
also in a short time was taken prisoner, and forced to submit;
as were also all the other princes of the country after the
king's example, being under great consternation at what had
happened. After an entire conquest of Ireland, he made a
voyage with his fleet to Iceland, which he also subdued.
And now a rumour spreading over the rest of the islands,
that no country was able to withstand him, Doldavius, king
of Gothland, and Gunfasius, king of the Orkneys, came
voluntarily, and made their submission, on a promise of paying
tribute. Then, as soon as winter was over, he returned
back to Britain, where having established the kingdom, he
resided in it for twelve years together in peace.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XI.</span>&mdash;<i>Arthur subdues Norway, Dacia, Aquitaine, and Gaul.</i></h3>


<p>After this, having invited over to him all persons whatsoever
that were famous for valour in foreign nations, he began
to augment the number of his domestics, and introduced such
politeness into his court, as people of the remotest countries
thought worthy of their imitation. So that there was not a
nobleman who thought himself of any consideration, unless
his clothes and arms were made in the same fashion as those
of Arthur's knights. At length the fame of his munificence
and valour spreading over the whole world, he became a terror
to the kings of other countries, who grievously feared
the loss of their dominions, if he should make any attempt
upon them. Being much perplexed with these anxious cares,
they repaired their cities and towers, and built towns in convenient
places, the better to fortify themselves against any
enterprise of Arthur, when occasion should require. Arthur,
being informed of what they were doing, was delighted to
find how much they stood in awe of him, and formed a
design for the conquest of all Europe. Then having prepared
his fleet, he first attempted Norway, that he might
procure the crown of it for Lot, his sister's husband. This
Lot was the nephew of Sichelin, king of the Norwegians,
who being then dead, had appointed him his successor in the
kingdom. But the Norwegians, disdaining to receive him,
had advanced one Riculf to the sovereignty, and having fortified
their cities, thought they were able to oppose Arthur.
Walgan, the son of Lot, was then a youth twelve years old,
and was recommended by his uncle to the service of pope
Supplicius, from whom he received arms. But to return to
the history: as soon as Arthur arrived on the coast of Norway,
king Riculf, attended with the whole power of that
kingdom, met him, and gave him battle, in which, after a
great loss of blood on both sides, the Britons at length had
the advantage, and making a vigorous charge, killed Riculf
and many others with him. Having thus defeated them,
they set the cities on fire, dispersed the country people, and
pursued the victory till they had reduced all Norway, as also
Dacia, under the dominion of Arthur. After the conquest
of these countries, and establishment of Lot upon the throne
of Norway, Arthur made a voyage to Gaul, and dividing his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
army into several bodies, began to lay waste that country on
all sides. The province of Gaul was then committed to
Flollo, a Roman tribune, who held the government of it under
the emperor Leo. Upon intelligence of Arthur's coming,
he raised all the forces that were under his command, and
made war against him, but without success. For Arthur was
attended with the youth of all the islands that he had subdued;
for which reason he was reported to have such an
army as was thought invincible. And even the greater part
of the Gallic army, encouraged by his bounty, came over to
his service. Therefore Flollo, seeing the disadvantages he lay
under, left his camp, and fled with a small number to Paris.
There having recruited his army, he fortified the city, and
resolved to stand another engagement with Arthur. But
while he was thinking of strengthening himself with auxiliary
forces in the neighbouring countries, Arthur came upon
him unawares, and besieged him in the city. When a month
had passed, Flollo, with grief observing his people perish
with hunger, sent a message to Arthur, that they two alone
should decide the conquest for the kingdom in a duel: for
being a person of great stature, boldness and courage, he
gave this challenge in confidence of success. Arthur was
extremely pleased at Flollo's proposal, and sent him word
back again, that he would give him the meeting which he
desired. A treaty, therefore, being on both sides agreed to,
they met together in the island without the city, where the
people waited to see the event. They were both gracefully
armed, and mounted on admirably swift horses; and it was
hard to tell which gave greater hopes of victory. When they
had presented themselves against each other with their lances
aloft, they put spurs to their horses, and began a fierce encounter.
But Arthur, who handled his lance more warily,
struck it into the upper part of Flollo's breast, and avoiding
his enemy's weapon, laid him prostrate upon the ground, and
was just going to despatch him with his drawn sword, when
Flollo, starting up on a sudden, met him with his lance
couched, wherewith he mortally stabbed the breast of Arthur's
horse, and caused both him and his rider to fall. The
Britons, when they saw their king lying on the ground,
fearing he was killed, could hardly be restrained from breach
of covenant, and falling with one consent upon the Gauls<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
But just as they were upon rushing into the lists, Arthur
hastily got up, and guarding himself with his shield, advanced
with speed against Flollo. And now they renewed the
assault with great rage, eagerly bent upon one another's
destruction. At length Flollo, watching his advantage, gave
Arthur a blow upon the forehead, which might have proved
mortal, had he not blunted the edge of his weapon against
the helmet. When Arthur saw his coat of mail and shield
red with blood, he was inflamed with still greater rage, and
lifting up his Caliburn with his utmost strength struck it
through the helmet into Flollo's head, and made a terrible
gash. With this wound Flollo fell down, tearing the ground
with his spurs, and expired. As soon as this news was
spread through the army, the citizens ran together, and opening
the gates, surrendered the city to Arthur. After the
victory, he divided his army into two parts; one of which he
committed to the conduct of Hoel, whom he ordered to march
against Guitard, commander of the Pictavians; while he
with the other part should endeavour to reduce the other
provinces. Hoel upon this entered Aquitaine, possessed
himself of the cities of that country, and after distressing
Guitard in several battles, forced him to surrender. He
also destroyed Gascony with fire and sword, and subdued
the princes of it. At the end of nine years, in which time
all the parts of Gaul were entirely reduced, Arthur returned
back to Paris, where he kept his court, and calling an assembly
of the clergy and people, established peace and the just
administration of the laws in that kingdom. Then he bestowed
Neustria, now called Normandy, upon Bedver, his
butler; the province of Andegavia upon Caius, his sewer;
and several other provinces upon his great men that attended
him. Thus having settled the peace of the cities and
countries there, he returned back in the beginning of spring
to Britain.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XII.</span>&mdash;<i>Arthur summons a great many kings, princes, archbishops,
&amp;c. to a solemn assembly at the City of Legions.</i></h3>


<p>Upon the approach of the feast of Pentecost, Arthur, the
better to demonstrate his joy after such triumphant success,
and for the more solemn observation of that festival, and
reconciling the minds of the princes that were now subject
to him, resolved, during that season, to hold a magnificent
court, to place the crown upon his head, and to invite all the
kings and dukes under his subjection, to the solemnity. And
when he had communicated his design to his familiar friends,
he pitched upon the City of Legions as a proper place for his
purpose. For besides its great wealth above the other cities,
its situation, which was in Glamorganshire upon the river
Uske, near the Severn sea, was most pleasant, and fit for so
great a solemnity. For on one side it was washed by that
noble river, so that the kings and princes from the countries
beyond the seas might have the convenience of sailing up to
it. On the other side, the beauty of the meadows and groves,
and magnificence of the royal palaces with lofty gilded roofs
that adorned it, made it even rival the grandeur of Rome.
It was also famous for two churches; whereof one was built
in honour of the martyr Julius, and adorned with a choir
of virgins, who had devoted themselves wholly to the service
of God; but the other, which was founded in memory of St.
Aaron, his companion, and maintained a convent of canons,
was the third metropolitan church of Britain. Besides, there
was a college of two hundred philosophers, who, being
learned in astronomy and the other arts, were diligent in
observing the courses of the stars, and gave Arthur true
predictions of the events that would happen at that time.
In this place, therefore, which afforded such delights, were
preparations made for the ensuing festival. Ambassadors
were then sent into several kingdoms, to invite to court the
princes both of Gaul and all the adjacent islands. Accordingly
there came Augusel, king of Albania, now
Scotland; Urian, king of Mureif; Cadwallo Lewirh, king
of the Venedotians, now called the North Wales men;
Sater, king of the Demetians, or South Wales men; Cador,
king of Cornwall; also the archbishops of the three metropolitan
sees, London, York, and Dubricius of the City of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
Legions. This prelate, who was primate of Britain, and
legate of the apostolical see, was so eminent for his piety,
that he could cure any sick person by his prayers. There
came also the consuls of the principal cities, viz. Morvid,
consul of Gloucester; Mauron, of Worcester; Anaraut, of
Salisbury; Arthgal, of Cargueit or Warguit; Jugein,
of Legecester; Cursalen, of Kaicester; Kinmare, duke
of Dorobernia; Galluc, of Salisbury; Urgennius, of Bath;
Jonathal, of Dorchester; Boso, of Ridoc, that is, Oxford.
Besides the consuls, came the following worthies of no less
dignity: Danaut, Map papo; Cheneus, Map coil; Peredur,
Mab eridur; Guiful, Map Nogoit; Regin, Map claut;
Eddelein, Map cledauc; Kincar, Mab bagan; Kimmare;
Gorboroniam, Map goit; Clofaut, Rupmaneton; Kimbelim,
Map trunat; Cathleus, Map catel; Kinlich, Map neton; and
many others too tedious to enumerate. From the adjacent
islands came Guillamurius, king of Ireland; Malvasius, king
of Iceland; Doldavius, king of Gothland; Gunfasius, king
of the Orkneys; Lot, king of Norway; Aschillius, king of
the Dacians. From the parts beyond the seas, came Holdin,
king of Ruteni; Leodegarius, consul of Bolonia; Bedver,
the butler, duke of Normandy; Borellus, of Cenomania;
Caius, the sewer, duke of Andegavia; Guitard, of Pictavia;
also the twelve peers of Gaul, whom Guerinus Carnotensis
brought along with him: Hoel, duke of the Armorican
Britons, and his nobility, who came with such a train of
mules, horses, and rich furniture, as it is difficult to describe.
Besides these, there remained no prince of any consideration
on this side of Spain, who came not upon this invitation.
And no wonder, when Arthur's munificence, which was
celebrated over the whole world, made him beloved by all
people.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XIII.</span>&mdash;<i>A description of the royal pomp at the coronation of
Arthur.</i></h3>


<p>When all were assembled together in the city, upon the day
of the solemnity, the archbishops were conducted to the
palace, in order to place the crown upon the king's head.
Therefore Dubricius, inasmuch as the court was kept in his
diocese, made himself ready to celebrate the office, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
undertook the ordering of whatever related to it. As soon
as the king was invested with his royal habiliments, he was
conducted in great pomp to the metropolitan church, supported
on each side by two archbishops, and having four
kings, viz. of Albania, Cornwall, Demetia, and Venedotia,
whose right it was, bearing four golden swords before him.
He was also attended with a concert of all sorts of music,
which made most excellent harmony. On another part was
the queen, dressed out in her richest ornaments, conducted
by the archbishops and bishops to the Temple of Virgins;
the four queens also of the kings last mentioned, bearing
before her four white doves according to ancient custom;
and after her there followed a retinue of women, making all
imaginable demonstrations of joy. When the whole procession
was ended, so transporting was the harmony of the musical
instruments and voices, whereof there was a vast variety in
both churches, that the knights who attended were in doubt
which to prefer, and therefore crowded from the one to the
other by turns, and were far from being tired with the
solemnity, though the whole day had been spent in it. At
last, when divine service was over at both churches, the king
and queen put off their crowns, and putting on their lighter
ornaments, went to the banquet; he to one palace with the
men, and she to another with the women. For the Britons
still observed the ancient custom of Troy, by which the men
and women used to celebrate their festivals apart. When
they had all taken their seats according to precedence, Caius
the sewer, in rich robes of ermine, with a thousand young
noblemen, all in like manner clothed with ermine, served up
the dishes. From another part, Bedver the butler was
followed with the same number of attendants, in various
habits, who waited with all kinds of cups and drinking
vessels. In the queen's palace were innumerable waiters,
dressed with variety of ornaments, all performing their
respective offices; which if I should describe particularly,
I should draw out the history to a tedious length. For at
that time Britain had arrived at such a pitch of grandeur,
that in abundance of riches, luxury of ornaments, and politeness
of inhabitants, it far surpassed all other kingdoms. The
knights in it that were famous for feats of chivalry, wore
their clothes and arms all of the same colour and fashion:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
and the women also no less celebrated for their wit, wore all
the same kind of apparel; and esteemed none worthy of their
love, but such as had given a proof of their valour in three
several battles. Thus was the valour of the men an
encouragement for the women's chastity, and the love of the
women a spur to the soldier's bravery.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XIV.</span>&mdash;<i>After a variety of sports at the coronation, Arthur amply
rewards his servants.</i></h3>


<p>As soon as the banquets were over, they went into the fields
without the city, to divert themselves with various sports.
The military men composed a kind of diversion in imitation
of a fight on horseback; and the ladies, placed on the top
of the walls as spectators, in a sportive manner darted their
amorous glances at the courtiers, the more to encourage
them. Others spent the remainder of the day in other
diversions, such as shooting with bows and arrows, tossing
the pike, casting of heavy stones and rocks, playing at dice
and the like, and all these inoffensively and without quarrelling.
Whoever gained the victory in any of these sports,
was rewarded with a rich prize by Arthur. In this manner
were the first three days spent; and on the fourth, all who,
upon account of their titles, bore any kind of office at this
solemnity, were called together to receive honours and
preferments in reward of their services, and to fill up
the vacancies in the governments of cities and castles,
archbishoprics, bishoprics, abbeys, and other posts of
honour.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XV.</span>&mdash;<i>A letter from Lucius Tiberius, general of the Romans, to
Arthur being read, they consult about an answer to it.</i></h3>


<p>But St. Dubricius, from a pious desire of leading a hermit's
life, made a voluntary resignation of his archiepiscopal
dignity; and in his room was consecrated David, the king's
uncle, whose life was a perfect example of that goodness
which by his doctrine he taught. In place of St. Samson,
archbishop of Dole, was appointed, with the consent of Hoel,
king of the Armorican Britons, Chelianus, [Kilian] a priest
of Llandaff, a person highly recommended for his good life
and character. The bishopric of Silchester was conferred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
upon Mauganius, that of Winchester upon Diwanius, and
that of Alclud upon Eledanius. While he was disposing
of these preferments upon them, it happened that twelve
men of an advanced age, and venerable aspect, and bearing
olive branches in their right hands, for a token that they
were come upon an embassy, appeared before the king,
moving towards him with a slow pace, and speaking with
a soft voice; and after their compliments paid, presented
him with a letter from Lucius Tiberius, in these words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lucius, procurator of the commonwealth, to Arthur,
king of Britain, according to his desert. The insolence
of your tyranny is what fills me with the highest admiration,
and the injuries you have done to Rome still increase my
wonder. But it is provoking to reflect, that you are grown
so much above yourself, as wilfully to avoid seeing this: nor
do you consider what it is to have offended by unjust deeds
a senate, to whom you cannot be ignorant the whole world
owes vassalage. For the tribute of Britain, which the senate
had enjoined you to pay, and which used to be paid to the
Roman emperors successively from the time of Julius C&aelig;sar,
you have had the presumption to withhold, in contempt of
their imperial authority. You have seized upon the province
of the Allobroges, and all the islands of the ocean, whose
kings, while the Roman power prevailed in those parts, paid
tribute to our ancestors. And because the senate have
decreed to demand justice of you for such repeated injuries,
I command you to appear at Rome before the middle of
August the next year, there to make satisfaction to your
masters, and undergo such sentence as they shall in justice
pass upon you. Which if you refuse to do, I shall come to
you, and endeavour to recover with my sword, what you in
your madness have robbed us of."</p>

<p>As soon as the letter was read in the presence of the kings
and consuls, Arthur withdrew with them into the Giant's
Tower, which was at the entrance of the palace, to think
what answer was fit to be returned to such an insolent message.
As they were going up the stairs, Cador, duke of
Cornwall, who was a man of a merry disposition, said to the
king in a jocose manner: "I have been till now under fear,
lest the easy life which the Britons lead, by enjoying a long
peace, might make them cowards, and extinguish the fame of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
their gallantry, by which they have raised their name above
all other nations. For where the exercise of arms is wanting,
and the pleasures of women, dice, and other diversions
take place, no doubt, what remains of virtue, honour, courage,
and thirst of praise, will be tainted with the rust of idleness.
For now almost five years have passed, since we have been
abandoned to these delights, and have had no exercise of war.
Therefore, to deliver us from sloth, God has stirred up this
spirit of the Romans, to restore our military virtues to their
ancient state." In this manner did he entertain them with
discourse, till they were come to their seats, on which
when they were all placed, Arthur spoke to them after this
manner.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XVI.</span>&mdash;<i>Arthur, holding a council with the kings, desires every one
of them to deliver their opinions.</i></h3>


<p>"My companions both in good and bad fortune, whose abilities
both in counsel and war I have hitherto experienced;
the present exigence of affairs, after the message which we
have received, requires your careful deliberation and prudent
resolutions; for whatever is wisely concerted, is easily executed.
Therefore we shall be the better able to bear the
annoyance which Lucius threatens to give us, if we unanimously
apply ourselves to consider how to overcome it. In
my opinion we have no great reason to fear him, when we
reflect upon the unjust pretence on which he demands
tribute of us. He says he has a right to it, because it was
paid to Julius C&aelig;sar, and his successors, who invaded
Britain with an army at the invitation of the ancient Britons,
when they were quarrelling among themselves, and by force
reduced the country under their power, when weakened by
civil dissension. And because they gained it in this manner,
they had the injustice to take tribute of it. For that can
never be possessed justly, which is gained by force and
violence. So that he has no reasonable grounds to pretend
we are of right his tributaries. But since he has the presumption
to make an unjust demand of us, we have certainly
as good reason to demand of him tribute from Rome; let
the longer sword therefore determine the right between us.
For if Rome has decreed that tribute ought to be paid to it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
from Britain, on account of its having been formerly under
the yoke of Julius C&aelig;sar, and other Roman emperors; I for
the same reason now decree, that Rome ought to pay tribute
to me, because my predecessors formerly held the government
of it. For Belinus, that glorious king of the Britons,
with the assistance of his brother Brennus, duke of the
Allobroges, after they had hanged up twenty noble Romans
in the middle of the market-place, took their city, and kept
possession of it a long time. Likewise Constantine, the son
of Helena, and Maximian [Maximus], who were both my
kinsmen, and both wore the crown of Britain, gained the imperial
throne of Rome. Do not you, therefore, think that we
ought to demand tribute of the Romans? As for Gaul and
the adjacent islands of the ocean, we have no occasion to
return them any answer, since they did not defend them,
when we attempted to free them from their power." As
soon as he had done speaking to this effect, Hoel, king of
the Armorican Britons, who had the precedence of the rest,
made answer in these words.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XVII.</span>&mdash;<i>The opinion of Hoel, king of Armorica, concerning a
war with the Romans.</i></h3>


<p>"After the most profound deliberation that any of us shall
be able to make, I think better advice cannot be given, than
what your majesty in your great wisdom and policy now offers.
Your speech, which is no less wise than eloquent, has superseded
all consultation on our part; and nothing remains for us
to do, but to admire and gratefully acknowledge your majesty's
firmness of mind, and depth of policy, to which we owe such
excellent advice. For if upon this motive you are pleased to
make an expedition to Rome, I doubt not but it will be crowned
with glorious success; since it will be undertaken for the defence
of our liberties, and to demand justly of our enemies,
what they have unjustly demanded of us. For that person who
would rob another, deserves to lose his own by him against
whom the attempt is made. And, therefore, since the Romans
threatened us with this injury, it will undoubtedly turn to
their own loss, if we can have but an opportunity of engaging
with them. This is what the Britons universally desire;
this is what we have promised us in the Sibylline prophecies,
which expressly declare, that the Roman empire shall be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
obtained by three persons, natives of Britain. The oracle
is fulfilled in two of them, since it is manifest (as your
majesty observed) that those two celebrated princes, Belinus
and Constantine, governed the Roman empire: and now you
are the third to whom this supreme dignity is promised.
Make haste, therefore, to receive what God makes no delay
to give you; to subdue those who are ready to receive your
yoke; and to advance us all, who for your advancement will
spare neither limbs nor life. And that you may accomplish this,
I myself will attend you in person with ten thousand men."</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XVIII.</span>&mdash;<i>The opinion of Augusel.</i></h3>


<p>When Hoel concluded his speech, Augusel, king of Albania,
declared his good affection to the cause after this manner.
"I am not able to express the joy that has transported me,
since my lord has declared to us his designs. For we seem
to have done nothing by all our past wars with so many and
potent princes, if the Romans and Germans be suffered to
enjoy peace, and we do not severely revenge on them the
grievous oppressions which they formerly brought upon this
country. But now, since we are at liberty to encounter
them, I am overwhelmed with joy and eagerness of desire,
to see a battle with them, when the blood of those cruel
oppressors will be no less acceptable to me than a spring of
water is to one who is parched with thirst. If I shall but
live to see that day, how sweet will be the wounds which
I shall then either receive or give? Nay, how sweet will
be even death itself, when suffered in revenging the injuries
done to our ancestors, in defending our liberties, and in promoting
the glory of our king! Let us then begin with
these poltroons, and spoil them of all their trophies, by
making an entire conquest of them. And I for my share
will add to the army two thousand horse, besides foot."</p>

<p>To the same effect spoke all the rest, and promised each of
them their full quota of forces; so that besides those promised
by the duke of Armorica, the number of men from
the island of Britain alone was sixty thousand, all completely
armed. But the kings of the other islands, as they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
had not been accustomed to any cavalry, promised their
quota of infantry; and, from the six provincial islands, viz.
Ireland, Iceland, Gothland, the Orkneys, Norway, and
Dacia, were reckoned a hundred and twenty thousand. From
the duchies of Gaul, that is, of the Ruteni, the Portunians,
the Estrusians, the Cenomanni, the Andegavians, and Pictavians,
were eighty thousand. From the twelve consulships
of those who came along with Guerinus Carnotensis, twelve
hundred. All together made up a hundred and eighty-three
thousand two hundred, besides foot which did not easily fall
under number.</p>

<p>King Arthur, seeing all unanimously ready for his service,
ordered them to return back to their countries with speed,
and get ready the forces which they had promised, and to
hasten to the general rendezvous upon the kalends of
August, at the mouth of the river Barba, that from thence
they might advance with them to the borders of the Allobroges,
to meet the Romans. Then he sent word to the
emperors by their ambassadors; that as to paying them
tribute, he would in no wise obey their commands; and that
the journey he was about to make to Rome, was not to stand
the award of their sentence, but to demand of them what
they had judicially decreed to demand of him. With this
answer the ambassadors departed; and at the same time
also departed all the kings and noblemen, to perform with
all expedition the orders that had been given them.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap.</span> II.&mdash;<i>Arthur commits to his nephew Modred the government of
Britain. His dream at Hamo's Port.</i></h3>


<p>After the necessary dispositions were made, upon the kalends
of August, they began their march towards Britain,
which when Arthur had intelligence of, he committed the
government of the kingdom to his nephew Modred, and
queen Guanhumara, and marched with his army to Hamo's
Port, where the wind stood fair for him. But while he, surrounded
with all his numerous fleet, was sailing joyfully with
a brisk gale, it happened that about midnight he fell into a
very sound sleep, and in a dream saw a bear flying in the
air, at the noise of which all the shores trembled; also a
terrible dragon flying from the west, which enlightened the
country with the brightness of its eyes. When these two
met, they began a dreadful fight; but the dragon with its fiery
breath burned the bear which often assaulted him, and threw
him down scorched to the ground. Arthur upon this awaking,
related his dream to those that stood about him, who
took upon them to interpret it, and told him that the dragon
signified himself, but the bear, some giant that should encounter
with him; and that the fight portended the duel
that would be between them, and the dragon's victory the
same that would happen to himself. But Arthur conjec<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>tured
it portended something else, and that the vision was
applicable to himself and the emperor. As soon as the
morning after this night's sail appeared, they found themselves
arrived at the mouth of the river Barba. And there
they pitched their tents, to wait the arrival of the kings of
the islands and the generals of the other provinces.</p>




<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. III.</span>&mdash;<i>Arthur kills a Spanish giant who had stolen away Helena,
the niece of Hoel.</i></h3>


<p>In the meantime Arthur had news brought him, that a giant
of monstrous size was come from the shores of Spain, and
had forcibly taken away Helena, the niece of duke Hoel,
from her guard, and fled with her to the top of that which
is now called Michael's Mount;<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> and that the soldiers of the
country who pursued him were able to do nothing against
him. For whether they attacked him by sea or land, he
either overturned their ships with vast rocks, or killed them
with several sorts of darts, besides many of them that he
took and devoured half alive. The next night, therefore, at
the second hour, Arthur, taking along with him Caius the
sewer, and Bedver the butler, went out privately from the
camp, and hastened towards the mountain. For being a man
of undaunted courage, he did not care to lead his army
against such monsters; both because he could in this manner
animate his men by his own example, and also because he
was alone sufficient to deal with them. As soon as they
came near the mountain, they saw a fire burning upon the top
of it, and another on a lesser mountain, that was not far
from it. And being in doubt upon which of them the giant
dwelt, they sent away Bedver to know the certainty of the
matter. So he, finding a boat, sailed over in it first to the
lesser mountain, to which he could in no other way have
access, because it was situated in the sea. When he had
begun to climb up to the top of it, he was at first frightened
with a dismal howling cry of a woman from above, and
imagined the monster to be there: but quickly rousing up
his courage, he drew his sword, and having reached the top,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
found nothing but the fire which he had before seen at a distance.
He discovered also a grave newly made, and an old
woman weeping and howling by it, who at the sight of him
instantly cried out in words interrupted with sighs, "O, unhappy
man, what misfortune brings you to this place? O the
inexpressible tortures of death that you must suffer! I pity
you, I pity you, because the detestable monster will this night
destroy the flower of your youth. For that most wicked and
odious giant, who brought the duke's niece, whom I have just
now buried here, and me, her nurse, along with her into this
mountain, will come and immediately murder you in a most
cruel manner. O deplorable fate! This most illustrious
princess, sinking under the fear her tender heart conceived,
while the foul monster would have embraced her, fainted
away and expired. And when he could not satiate his
brutish lust upon her, who was the very soul, joy, and happiness
of my life, being enraged at the disappointment of his
bestial desire, he forcibly committed a rape upon me, who
(let God and my old age witness) abhorred his embraces.
Fly, dear sir, fly, for fear he may come, as he usually does,
to lie with me, and finding you here most barbarously butcher
you." Bedver, moved at what she said, as much as it is
possible for human nature to be, endeavoured with kind
words to assuage her grief, and to comfort her with the
promise of speedy help: and then returned back to Arthur,
and gave him an account of what he had met with. Arthur
very much lamented the damsel's sad fate, and ordered his
companions to leave him to deal with him alone; unless there
was an absolute necessity, and then they were to come in
boldly to his assistance. From hence they went directly to
the next mountain, leaving their horses with their armour-bearers,
and ascended to the top, Arthur leading the way.
The deformed savage was then by the fire, with his face
besmeared with the clotted blood of swine, part of which he
already devoured, and was roasting the remainder upon spits
by the fire. But at the sight of them, whose appearance
was a surprise to him, he hastened to his club, which two
strong men could hardly lift from the ground. Upon this
the king drew his sword, and guarding himself with his
shield, ran with all his speed to prevent his getting it. But
the other, who was not ignorant of his design, had by this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
time snatched it up, and gave the king such a terrible blow
upon his shield, that he made the shores ring with the noise,
and perfectly stunned the king's ears with it. Arthur, fired
with rage at this, lifted up his sword, and gave him a wound
in the forehead, which was not indeed mortal, but yet such
as made the blood gush out over his face and eyes, and so
blinded him; for he had partly warded off the stroke from
his forehead with his club, and prevented its being fatal.
However, his loss of sight, by reason of the blood flowing
over his eyes, made him exert himself with greater fury, and
like an enraged boar against a hunting-spear, so did he rush
in against Arthur's sword, and grasping him about the waist,
forced him down upon his knees. But Arthur, nothing
daunted, slipped out of his hands, and so exerted himself
with his sword, that he gave the giant no respite till he had
struck it up to the very back through his skull. At this
the hideous monster raised a dreadful roar, and like an oak
torn up from the roots by the winds, so did he make the
ground resound with his fall. Arthur, bursting out into a
fit of laughter at the sight, commanded Bedver to cut off his
head, and give it to one of the armour-bearers, who was to
carry it to the camp, and there expose it to public view,
but with orders for the spectators of this combat to keep
silence. He told them he had found none of so great strength,
since he killed the giant Ritho, who had challenged him to
fight, upon the mountain Aravius. This giant had made
himself furs of the beards of kings he had killed, and had
sent word to Arthur carefully to cut off his beard and send
it to him; and then, out of respect to his pre-eminence over
other kings, his beard should have the honour of the principal
place. But if he refused to do it, he challenged him to a
duel, with this offer, that the conqueror should have the furs,
and also the beard of the vanquished for a trophy of his
victory. In his conflict, therefore, Arthur proved victorious,
and took the beard and spoils of the giant: and, as he said
before, had met with none that could be compared to him
for strength, till his last engagement. After this victory,
they returned at the second watch of the night to the camp
with the head; to see which there was a great concourse of
people, all extolling this wonderful exploit of Arthur, by
which he had freed the country from a most destructive and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
voracious monster. But Hoel, in great grief for the loss of
his niece, commanded a mausoleum to be built over her body
in the mountain where she was buried, which, taking the
damsel's name, is called Helena's Tomb to this day.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. IV.</span> <i>Arthur's ambassadors to Lucius Tiberius deliver Pelreius
Cotta, whom they took prisoner to Arthur.</i></h3>


<p>As soon as all the forces were arrived which Arthur expected,
he marched from thence to Augustodunum, where he supposed
the general was. But when he came to the river
Alba, he had intelligence brought him of his having encamped
not far off, and that he was come with so vast an army, that
he would not be able to withstand it. However, this did not
deter him from pursuing his enterprise; but he pitched his
camp upon the bank of the river, to facilitate the bringing
up of his forces, and to secure his retreat, if there should be
occasion; and sent Boso the consul of Oxford, and Guerinus
Carnotensis, with his nephew Walgan, to Lucius Tiberius,
requiring him either to retire from the coasts of Gaul, or
come the next day, that they might try their right to that
country with their swords. The retinue of young courtiers
that attended Walgan, highly rejoicing at this opportunity,
were urgent with him to find some occasion for a quarrel in
the commander's camp, that so they might engage the Romans.
Accordingly they went to Lucius, and commanded him to
retire out of Gaul, or hazard a battle the next day. But
while he was answering them, that he was not come to retire,
but to govern the country, there was present Caius Quintilianus,
his nephew, who said, "That the Britons were better
at boasting and threatening, than they were at fighting."
Walgan immediately took fire at this, and ran upon him with
his drawn sword, wherewith he cut off his head, and then
retreated speedily with his companions to their horses. The
Romans, both horse and foot, pursued to revenge the loss of
their countryman upon the ambassadors, who fled with great
precipitation. But Guerinus Carnotensis, just as one of
them was come up to him, rallied on a sudden, and with his
lance struck at once through his armour and the very middle
of his body, and laid him prostrate on the ground. The
sight of this noble exploit raised the emulation of Boso of
Oxford, who, wheeling about his horse, struck his lance into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
the throat of the first man he met with, and dismounted him
mortally wounded. In the meantime, Marcellus Mutius,
with great eagerness to revenge Quintilian's death, was just
upon the back of Walgan, and laid hold of him; which the
other quickly obliged him to quit, by cleaving both his
helmet and head to the breast with his sword. He also bade
him, when he arrived at the infernal regions, tell the man he
had killed in the camp, "That in this manner the Britons
showed their boasting and threatening." Then having re-assembled
his men, he encouraged them to despatch every
one his pursuer in the same manner as he had done; which
accordingly they did not fail to accomplish. Notwithstanding,
the Romans continued their pursuit with lances and
swords, wherewith they annoyed the others, though without
slaughter or taking any prisoners. But as they came near a
certain wood, a party of six thousand Britons, who seeing
the flight of the consuls, had hid themselves, to be in readiness
for their assistance, sallied forth, and putting spurs to
their horses, rent the air with their loud shouts, and being
well fenced with their shields, assaulted the Romans suddenly,
and forced them to fly. And now it was the Britons'
turn to pursue, which they did with better success, for they
dismounted, killed, or took several of the enemy. Petreius,
the senator, upon this news, hastened to the assistance of his
countrymen with ten thousand men, and compelled the Britons
to retreat to the wood from whence they had sallied forth;
though not without loss of his own men. For the Britons,
being well acquainted with the ground, in their flight killed
a great number of their pursuers. The Britons thus giving
ground, Hider, with another reinforcement of five thousand
men, advanced with speed to sustain them; so that they
again faced those, upon whom they had turned their backs,
and renewed the assault with great vigour. The Romans
also stood their ground, and continued the fight with various
success. The great fault of the Britons was, that though
they had been very eager to begin the fight, yet when begun
they were less careful of the hazard they ran. Whereas the
Romans were under better discipline, and had the advantage
of a prudent commander, Petreius Cotta, to tell them where
to advance, and where to give ground, and by these means
did great injury to the enemy. When Boso observed this,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
he drew off from the rest a large party of those whom he
knew to be the stoutest men, and spoke to them after this
manner: "Since we have begun this fight without Arthur's
knowledge, we must take care that we be not defeated in
the enterprise. For, if we should, we shall both very much
endanger our men, and incur the king's high displeasure.
Rouse up your courage, and follow me through the Roman
squadrons, that with the favour of good fortune we may
either kill or take Petreius prisoner." With this they put
spurs to their horses, and piercing through the enemies'
thickest ranks, reached the place where Petreius was giving
his commands. Boso hastily ran in upon him, and grasping
him about the neck, fell with him to the ground, as he had
intended. The Romans hereupon ran to his delivery, as did
the Britons to Boso's assistance; which occasioned on both
sides great slaughter, noise, and confusion, while one party
strove to rescue their leader, and the other to keep him
prisoner. So that this proved the sharpest part of the whole
fight, and wherein their spears, swords, and arrows had the
fullest employment. At length, the Britons, joining in a
close body, and sustaining patiently the assaults of the
Romans, retired to the main body of their army with Petreius:
which they had no sooner done, than they again
attacked them, being now deprived of their leader, very much
weakened, dispirited, and just beginning to flee. They,
therefore, eagerly pursued, beat down, and killed several of
them, and as soon as they had plundered them, pursued the
rest: but they took the greatest number of them prisoners,
being desirous to present them to the king. When they had
at last sufficiently harassed them, they returned with their
plunder and prisoners to the camp; where they gave an
account of what had happened, and presented Petreius Cotta
with the other prisoners before Arthur, with great joy for
the victory. Arthur congratulated them upon it, and promised
them advancement to greater honours, for behaving
themselves so gallantly when he was absent from them.
Then he gave his command to some of his men, to conduct
the prisoners the next day to Paris, and deliver them to be
kept in custody there till further orders. The party that
were to undertake this charge, he ordered to be conducted
by Cador, Bedver, and the two consuls, Borellus and Rich<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>erius,
with their servants, till they should be out of all fear
of disturbance from the Romans.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. V.</span>&mdash;<i>The Romans attack the Britons with a very great force, but
are put to flight by them.</i></h3>


<p>But the Romans, happening to get intelligence of their design,
at the command of their general chose out fifteen thousand
men, who that night were to get before the others in
their march, and rescue their fellow soldiers out of their
hands. They were to be commanded by Vulteius Catellus
and Quintus Carutius, senators, as also Evander, king of
Syria, and Sertorius, king of Libya. Accordingly they
began their march that very night, and possessed themselves
of a place convenient for lying in ambuscade, through
which they supposed the others would pass. In the
morning the Britons set forward along the same road with
their prisoners, and were now approaching the place in perfect
ignorance of the cunning stratagem of the enemy. No
sooner had they entered it, than the Romans, to their great
surprise, sprang forth and fell furiously upon them. Notwithstanding,
the Britons, at length recovering from their
consternation, assembled together, and prepared for a bold
opposition, by appointing a party to guard the prisoners, and
drawing out the rest in order of battle against the enemy.
Richerius and Bedver had the command of the party that
were set over the prisoners; but Cador, duke of Cornwall,
and Borellus headed the others. But all the Romans had
made their sally without being placed in any order, and
cared not to form themselves, that they might lose no time
in the slaughter of the Britons, whom they saw busied in
marshalling their troops, and preparing only for their
defence. By this conduct the Britons were extremely weakened,
and would have shamefully lost their prisoners, had
not good fortune rendered them assistance. For Guitard,
commander of the Pictavians, happened to get information
of the designed stratagem, and was come up with three thousand
men, by the help of which they at last got the advantage,
and paid back the slaughter upon their insolent assailants.
Nevertheless, the loss which they sustained at the
beginning of this action was very considerable. For they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
lost Borellus, the famous consul of the Cenomanni, in an
encounter with Evander, king of Syria, who stuck his lance
into his throat; besides four noblemen, viz. Hirelgas Deperirus,
Mauricius Cadorcanensis, Aliduc of Tintagel, and
Hider his son, than whom braver men were hardly to be
found. But yet neither did this loss dispirit the Britons, but
rather made them more resolute to keep the prisoners, and kill
the enemy. The Romans, now finding themselves unable to
maintain the fight any longer, suddenly quitted the field, and
made towards their camp; but were pursued with slaughter
by the Britons, who also took many of them, and allowed
them no respite till they had killed Vulteius Catellus and
Evander, king of Syria, and wholly dispersed the rest.
After which they sent away their former prisoners to Paris,
whither they were to conduct them, and returned back with
those newly taken to the king; to whom they gave great
hopes of a complete conquest of their enemies, since very
few of the great number that came against them had met
with any success.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. VI.</span>&mdash;<i>Lucius Tiberius goes to Lengri&aelig;. Arthur, designing to vanquish
him, by a stratagem possesses himself of the valley of Suesia.</i></h3>


<p>These repeated disasters wrought no small disturbance in
the mind of Lucius Tiberius, and made him hesitate whether
to bring it to a general battle with Arthur, or to retire into
Augustodunum, and stay till the emperor Leo with his forces
could come to his assistance. At length, giving way to his fears,
he entered Lengri&aelig; with his army, intending to reach the other
city the night following. Arthur, finding this, and being
desirous to get before him in his march, left the city on the
left hand, and the same night entered a certain valley called
Suesia, through which Lucius was to pass. There he
divided his men into several bodies, commanding one legion,
over which Morvid, consul of Gloucester, was appointed
general, to wait close by, that he might retreat to them if
there should be occasion, and from thence rally his broken
forces for a second battle. The rest he divided into seven
parts, in each of which he placed five thousand five hundred
and fifty-five men, all completely armed. He also appointed
different stations to his horse and foot, and gave command<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
that just as the foot should advance to the attack, the horse,
keeping close together in their ranks, should at the same
moment march up obliquely, and endeavour to put the
enemy into disorder. The companies of foot were, after the
British manner, drawn out into a square, with a right and
left wing, under the command of Augusel, king of Albania,
and Cador, duke of Cornwall; the one presiding over the
right wing, the other over the left. Over another party
were placed the two famous consuls, Guerinus of Chartres
and Boso of Richiden, called in the Saxon tongue Oxineford;
over a third were Aschillius, king of the Dacians, and Lot,
king of the Norwegians; the fourth being commanded by
Hoel, duke of the Armoricans, and Walgan, the king's
nephew. After these were four other parties placed in the
rear; the first commanded by Caius the sewer, and Bedver
the butler; the second by Holdin, duke of the Ruteni, and
Guitard of the Pictavians; the third by Vigenis of Legecester,
Jonathal of Dorchester, and Cursalem of Caicester;
the fourth by Urbgennius of Bath. Behind all these,
Arthur, for himself and the legion that was to attend near
him, made choice of a place, where he set up a golden
dragon for a standard, whither the wounded or fatigued
might in case of necessity retreat, as into their camp. The
legion that was with him consisted of six thousand six hundred
and sixty-six men.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. VII.</span>&mdash;<i>Arthur's exhortation to his soldiers.</i></h3>


<p>After he had thus placed them all in their stations, he
made the following speech to his soldiers:&mdash;"My brave
countrymen, who have made Britain the mistress of thirty
kingdoms, I congratulate you upon your late noble exploit,
which to me is a proof that your valour is so far from being
impaired, that it is rather increased. Though you have
been five years without exercise, wherein the softening
pleasures of an easy life had a greater share of your time
than the use of arms; yet all this has not made you degenerate
from your natural bravery, which you have shown in
forcing the Romans to flee. The pride of their leaders has
animated them to attempt the invasion of your liberties.
They have tried you in battle, with numbers superior to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
yours, and have not been able to stand before you; but have
basely withdrawn themselves into that city, from which they
are now ready to march out, and to pass through this valley
in their way to Augustodunum; so that you may have an
opportunity of falling upon them unawares like a flock of
sheep. Certainly they expected to find in you the cowardice
of the Eastern nations, when they thought to make your
country tributary, and you their slaves. What, have they
never heard of your wars, with the Dacians, Norwegians,
and princes of the Gauls, whom you reduced under my
power, and freed from their shameful yoke? We, then, that
have had success in a greater war, need not doubt of it in a
less, if we do but endeavour with the same spirit to vanquish
these poltroons. You shall want no rewards of honour,
if as faithful soldiers you do but strictly obey my commands.
For as soon as we have routed them, we will
march straight to Rome, and take it; and then all the
gold, silver, palaces, towers, towns, cities, and other riches
of the vanquished shall be yours." He had hardly done
speaking before they all with one voice declared, that they
were ready to suffer death, rather than quit the field while
he had life.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. VIII.</span>&mdash;<i>Lucius Tiberius, discovering Arthur's design, in a speech
animates his followers to fight.</i></h3>


<p>But Lucius Tiberius, discovering the designs that were
formed against him, would not flee, as he had at first intended,
but taking new courage, resolved to march to the
same valley against them; and calling together his principal
commanders, spoke to them in these words:&mdash;"Venerable
fathers, to whose empire both the Eastern and Western
kingdoms owe obedience, remember the virtues of your
ancestors, who were not afraid to shed their blood, when the
vanquishing of the enemies of the commonwealth required
it; but to leave an example of their courage and military
virtues to their posterity, behaved themselves in all battles
with that contempt of death, as if God had given them some
security against it. By this conduct they often triumphed,
and by triumphing escaped death. Such was the reward of
their virtue from Divine Providence, which overrules all
events. The increase of the commonwealth, and of their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
own valour was owing to this; and all those virtues that
usually adorn the great, as integrity, honour, and munificence,
flourishing a long time in them, raised them and their
posterity to the empire of the whole world. Let their noble
examples animate you: rouse up the spirit of the ancient Romans,
and be not afraid to march out against our enemies that
are lying in ambush before us in the valley, but boldly with
your swords demand of them your just rights. Do not think
that I retired into this city for fear of engaging with them;
but I thought that, as their pursuit of us was rash and foolish,
so we might hence on a sudden intercept them in it, and by
dividing their main body make a great slaughter of them.
But now, since they have altered the measures which we
supposed they had taken, let us also alter ours. Let us go
in quest of them and bravely fall upon them; or if they
shall happen to have the advantage in the beginning of the
battle, let us only stand our ground during the fury of their
first assault, and the victory will undoubtedly be ours; for
in many battles this manner of conduct has been attended
with victory." As soon as he had made an end of speaking
these and other things, they all declared their assent, promised
with an oath to stand by him, and hastened to arm
themselves. Which when they had done, they marched
out of Lengri&aelig; to the valley where Arthur had drawn out
his forces in order of battle. Then they also began to marshal
their army, which they divided into twelve companies,
and according to the Roman manner of battle, drew out each
company into the form of a wedge, consisting of six thousand
six hundred and sixty-six men. Each company also
had its respective leaders, who were to give direction when
to advance, or when to be upon the defensive. One of them
was headed by Lucius Catellus the senator, and Alifantinam,
king of Spain; another by Hirtacius, king of the Parthians,
and Marius Lepidus, a senator; a third by Boccus, king of
the Medes, and Caius Metellus, a senator; a fourth by Sertorius,
king of Libya, and Quintus Milvius, a senator.
These four companies were placed in the front of the
army. In the rear of these were four others, whereof
one was commanded by Serses, king of the Itureans;
another by Pandrasus, king of Egypt; a third by Polytetes,
duke of Bithynia; a fourth by Teucer, duke of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
Phrygia. And again behind all these four others, whereof
the commanders were Quintus Carucius, a senator, L&aelig;lius
Ostiensis, Sulpitius Subuculus, and Mauricius Sylvanus.
As for the general himself, he was sometimes in one place,
sometimes another, to encourage and direct as there should
be occasion. For a standard he ordered a golden eagle
to be firmly set up in the centre, for his men to repair to
whenever they should happen to be separated from their
company.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. IX.</span>&mdash;<i>A battle between Arthur and Lucius Tiberius.</i></h3>


<p>And now the Britons and Romans stood presenting their
arms at one another; when forthwith at the sound of the
trumpets, the company that was headed by the king of Spain
and Lucius Catellus, boldly rushed forward against that
which the king of Scotland and duke of Cornwall led, but
were not able to make the least breach in their firm ranks.
So that while these stood their ground, up came Guerinus
and Boso with a body of horse upon their full speed, broke
through the party that began the assault, and met with
another which the king of the Parthians was leading up
against Aschillius, king of Dacia. After this first onset,
there followed a general engagement of both armies with
great violence, and several breaches were made on each side.
The shouts, the slaughter, the quantity of blood spilled, and
the agonies of the dying, made a dreadful scene of horror.
At first, the Britons sustained a great loss, by having Bedver
the butler killed, and Caius the sewer mortally wounded.
For, as Bedver met Boccus, king of the Medes, he fell dead
by a stab of his lance amidst the enemies' troops. And
Caius, in endeavouring to revenge his death, was surrounded
by the Median troops, and there received a mortal wound,
yet as a brave soldier he opened himself a way with the wing
which he led, killed and dispersed the Medes, and would
have made a safe retreat with all his men, had he not met
the king of Libya with the forces under him, who put his
whole company into disorder; yet not so great, but that he
was still able to get off with a few, and flee with Bedver's
corps to the golden dragon. The Neustrians grievously
lamented at the sight of their leader's mangled body; and so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
did the Andegavians, when they beheld their consul wounded.
But there was now no room for complaints, for the furious
and bloody shocks of both armies made it necessary to
provide for their own defence. Therefore Hirelgas, the
nephew of Bedver, being extremely enraged at his death,
called up to him three hundred men, and like a wild boar
amongst a pack of dogs, broke through the enemies' ranks
with his horse, making towards the place where he had seen
the standard of the king of the Medes; little regarding what
might befall him, if he could but revenge the loss of his
uncle. At length he reached the place, killed the king,
brought off his body to his companions, and laid it by that
of his uncle, where he mangled it in the same manner. Then
calling with a loud voice to his countrymen, he animated
their troops, and vehemently pressed them to exert themselves
to the utmost, now that their spirits were raised, and
the enemy disheartened; and especially as they had the
advantage of them in being placed in better order, and so
might the more grievously annoy them. Encouraged with
this exhortation, they began a general assault upon the
enemy, which was attended with a terrible slaughter on both
sides. For on the part of the Romans, besides many others,
fell Alifantinam, king of Spain, Micipsa of Babylon, as also
Quintus Milvius and Marius Lepidus, senators. On the part
of the Britons, Holdin, king of the Ruteni, Leodegarius of
Bolonia, and three consuls of Britain, Cursalem of Caicester,
Galluc of Salisbury, and Urbgennius of Bath. So that the
troops which they commanded, being extremely weakened,
retreated till they came to the army of the Armorican
Britons, commanded by Hoel and Walgan. But these,
being inflamed at the retreat of their friends, encouraged
them to stand their ground, and caused them with the help
of their own forces to put their pursuers to flight. While
they continued this pursuit, they beat down and killed
several of them, and gave them no respite, till they came
to the general's troop; who, seeing the distress of his companions,
hastened to their assistance.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. X.</span>&mdash;<i>Hoel and Walgan signalize their valour in the fight.</i></h3>


<p>And now in this latter encounter the Britons were worsted,
with the loss of Kimarcoc, consul of Trigeria, and two thou<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>sand
with him; besides three famous noblemen, Richomarcus,
Bloccovius, and Jagivius of Bodloan, who, had they but
enjoyed the dignity of princes, would have been celebrated
for their valour through all succeeding ages. For, during
this assault which they made in conjunction with Hoel and
Walgan, there was not an enemy within their reach that
could escape the fury of their sword or lance. But upon
their falling in among Lucius's party, they were surrounded
by them, and suffered the same fate with the consul and the
other men. The loss of these men made those matchless
heroes, Hoel and Walgan, much more eager to assault the
general's ranks, and to try on all sides where to make the
greatest impression. But Walgan, whose valour was never
to be foiled, endeavoured to gain access to Lucius himself,
that he might encounter him, and with this view beat down
and killed all that stood in his way. And Hoel, not inferior
to him, did no less service in another part, by spiriting up
his men, and giving and receiving blows among the enemy
with the same undaunted courage. It was hard to determine,
which of them was the stoutest soldier.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XI.</span>&mdash;<i>Lucius Tiberius being killed, the Britons obtain the victory.</i></h3>


<p>But Walgan, by forcing his way through the enemy's troops,
as we said before, found at last (what he had wished for)
access to the general, and immediately encountered him.
Lucius, being then in the flower of his youth, and a person
of great courage and vigour, desired nothing more than to
engage with such a one as might put his strength to its full
trial. Putting himself, therefore, into a posture of defence, he
received Walgan with joy, and was not a little proud to try
his courage with one of whom he had heard such great things.
The fight continued between them a long time, with great
force of blows, and no less dexterity in warding them off,
each being resolved upon the other's destruction. During
this sharp conflict between them, the Romans, on a sudden,
recovering their courage, made an assault upon the Armoricans,
and having relieved their general, repulsed Hoel and
Walgan, with their troops, till they found themselves
unawares met by Arthur and the forces under him. For
he, hearing of the slaughter that was a little before made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
of his men, had speedily advanced with his legion, and
drawing out his Caliburn, spoke to them, with a loud voice,
after this manner: "What are you doing, soldiers? Will
you suffer these effeminate wretches to escape? Let not one
of them get off alive. Remember the force of your arms,
that have reduced thirty kingdoms under my subjection.
Remember your ancestors, whom the Romans, when at the
height of their power, made tributary. Remember your
liberties, which these pitiful fellows, that are much your
inferiors, attempt to deprive you of. Let none of them
escape alive. What are you doing?" With these expostulations,
he rushed upon the enemy, made terrible havoc
among them, and not a man did he meet but at one blow
he laid either him or his horse dead upon the ground. They,
therefore, in astonishment fled from him, as a flock of sheep
from a fierce lion, whom raging hunger provokes to devour
whatever happens to come near him. Their arms were no
manner of protection to them against the force with which
this valiant prince wielded his Caliburn. Two kings,
Sertorius of Libya, and Polytetes of Bithynia, unfortunately
felt its fury, and had their heads cut off by it. The Britons,
when they saw the king performing such wonders, took
courage again. With one consent they assaulted the
Romans, kept close together in their ranks, and while
they assailed the foot in one part, endeavoured to beat
down and pierce through the horse in another. Notwithstanding,
the Romans made a brave defence, and at the
instigation of Lucius laboured to pay back their slaughter
upon the Britons. The eagerness and force that were now
shown on both sides were as great as if it was the beginning
of the battle. Arthur continued to do great execution with
his own hand, and encouraged the Britons to maintain the
fight; as Lucius Tiberius did the Romans, and made them
perform many memorable exploits. He himself, in the
meantime, was very active in going from place to place,
and suffered none to escape with life that happened to come
within the reach of his sword or lance. The slaughter that
was now made on both sides was very dreadful, and the
turns of fortune various, sometimes the Britons prevailing,
sometimes the Romans. At last, while this sharp dispute
continued Morvid, consul of Gloucester with his legion,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
which, as we said before, was placed between the hills, came
up with speed upon the rear of the enemy, and to their great
surprise assaulted, broke through, and dispersed them with
great slaughter. This last and decisive blow proved fatal to
many thousands of Romans, and even to the general Lucius
himself, who was killed among the crowds with a lance by
an unknown hand. But the Britons, by long maintaining
the fight, at last with great difficulty gained the victory.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XII.</span>&mdash;<i>Part of the Romans flee; the rest, of their own accord,
surrender themselves for slaves.</i></h3>


<p>The Romans, being now, therefore, dispersed, betook themselves
through fear, some to the by-ways and woods, some to
the cities and towns, and all other places, where they could
be most safe; but were either killed or taken and plundered
by the Britons who pursued: so that great part of them
voluntarily and shamefully held forth their hands, to receive
their chains, in order to prolong for a while a wretched life.
In all which the justice of Divine Providence was very
visible; considering how unjustly the ancestors of the Britons
were formerly invaded and harassed by those of the Romans;
and that these stood only in defence of that liberty, which
the others would have deprived them of; and refused the
tribute, which the others had no right to demand.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XIII.</span>&mdash;<i>The bodies of the slain are decently buried, each in their
respective countries.</i></h3>


<p>Arthur, after he had completed his victory, gave orders for
separating the bodies of his nobility from those of the enemy,
and preparing a pompous funeral for them; and that, when
ready, they should be carried to the abbeys of their respective
countries, there to be honourably buried. But Bedver the
butler was, with great lamentation of the Neustrians, carried
to his own city Bajoc&aelig;, which Bedver the first, his great
grandfather, had built. There he was, with great solemnity,
laid close by the wall, in a burying-place on the south side of
the city. But Cheudo was carried, grievously wounded to
Camus, a town which he had himself built, where in a short
time he died of his wounds, and was buried, as became a
duke of Andegavia, in a convent of hermits, which was in
a wood not far from the town. Also Holdin, duke of Ruteni,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
was carried to Flanders, and buried in his own city Terivana.
The other consuls and noblemen were conveyed to the neighbouring
abbeys, according to Arthur's orders. Out of his
great clemency, also, he ordered the country people to take
care of the burial of the enemy, and to carry the body of
Lucius to the senate, and tell them, that was the only tribute
which Britain ought to pay them. After this he stayed in
those parts till the next winter was over, and employed his
time in reducing the cities of the Allobroges. But at the
beginning of the following summer, as he was on his march
towards Rome, and was beginning to pass the Alps, he had
news brought him that his nephew Modred, to whose care
he had entrusted Britain, had by tyrannical and treasonable
practices set the crown upon his own head; and that queen
Guanhumara, in violation of her first marriage, had wickedly
married him.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3>BOOK XI.</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. I.</span>&mdash;<i>Modred makes a great slaughter of Arthur's men, but is
beaten, and flees to Winchester.</i></h3>


<p>Of the matter now to be treated of, most noble consul,
Geoffrey of Monmouth shall be silent; but will, nevertheless,
though in a mean style, briefly relate what he found in the
British book above-mentioned, and heard from that most
learned historian, Walter, archdeacon of Oxford, concerning
the wars which this renowned king, upon his return to Britain
after this victory, waged against his nephew. As soon,
therefore, as the report, of this flagrant wickedness reached
him, he immediately desisted from his enterprise against Leo,
king of the Romans; and having sent away Hoel, duke of
the Armoricans, with the army of Gaul, to restore peace in
those parts, returned back with speed to Britain, attended
only by the kings of the islands, and their armies. But the
wicked traitor, Modred, had sent Cheldric, the Saxon leader,
into Germany, there to raise all the forces he could find, and
return with all speed: and in consideration of this service,
had promised him all that part of the island, which reaches<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
from the Humber to Scotland, and whatever Hengist and
Horsa had possessed of Kent in the time of Vortigern. So
that he, in obedience to his commands, had arrived with
eight hundred ships filled with pagan soldiers, and had
entered into covenant to obey the traitor as his sovereign;
who had also drawn to his assistance the Scots, Picts, Irish,
and all others whom he knew to be enemies to his uncle.
His whole army, taking pagans and Christians together,
amounted to eighty thousand men; with the help of whom
he met Arthur just after his landing at the port of Rutupi,
and joining battle with him, made a very great slaughter of
his men. For the same day fell Augusel, king of Albania,
and Walgan, the king's nephew, with innumerable others.
Augusel was succeeded in his kingdom by Eventus, his
brother Urian's son, who afterwards performed many famous
exploits in those wars. After they had at last, with much
difficulty, got ashore, they paid back the slaughter, and put
Modred and his army to flight. For, by long practice in
war, they had learned an excellent way of ordering their
forces; which was so managed, that while their foot were
employed either in an assault or upon the defensive, the
horse would come in at full speed obliquely, break through
the enemy's ranks, and so force them to flee. Nevertheless,
this perjured usurper got his forces together again, and the
night following entered Winchester. As soon as queen
Guanhumara heard this, she immediately, despairing of success,
fled from York to the City of Legions, where she resolved
to lead a chaste life among the nuns in the church of Julius
the Martyr, and entered herself one of their order.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. II.</span>&mdash;<i>Modred, after being twice besieged and routed, is killed.
Arthur, being wounded, gives up the kingdom to Constantine.</i></h3>


<p>But Arthur, whose anger was now much more inflamed,
upon the loss of so many hundreds of his fellow soldiers,
after he had buried his slain, went on the third day to the
city, and there besieged the traitor, who, notwithstanding,
was unwilling to desist from his enterprise, but used all
methods to encourage his adherents, and marching out with
his troops prepared to fight his uncle. In the battle that
followed hereupon, great numbers lost their lives on both
sides; but at last Modred's army suffered most, so that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
was forced to quit the field shamefully. From hence he made
a precipitate flight, and, without taking any care for the
burial of his slain, marched in haste towards Cornwall.
Arthur, being inwardly grieved that he should so often
escape, forthwith pursued him into that country as far as the
river Cambula, where the other was expecting his coming.
And Modred, as he was the boldest of men, and always the
quickest at making an attack, immediately placed his troops
in order, resolving either to conquer or to die, rather than
continue his flight any longer. He had yet remaining with
him sixty thousand men, out of whom he composed three
bodies, which contained each of them six thousand six hundred
and sixty-six men: but all the rest he joined in one
body; and having assigned to each of the other parties their
leaders, he took the command of this upon himself. After
he had made this disposition of his forces, he endeavoured to
animate them, and promised them the estates of their enemies
if they came off with victory. Arthur, on the other side,
also marshalled his army, which he divided into nine square
companies, with a right and left wing; and having appointed
to each of them their commanders, exhorted them to make a
total rout of those robbers and perjured villains, who, being
brought over into the island from foreign countries at the
instance of the arch-traitor, were attempting to rob them of
all their honours. He likewise told them that a mixed army
composed of barbarous people of so many different countries,
and who were all raw soldiers and inexperienced in war,
would never be able to stand against such brave veteran
troops as they were, provided they did their duty. After
this encouragement given by each general to his fellow
soldiers, the battle on a sudden began with great fury;
wherein it would be both grievous and tedious to relate the
slaughter, the cruel havoc, and the excess of fury that was
to be seen on both sides. In this manner they spent a good
part of the day, till Arthur at last made a push with his company,
consisting of six thousand six hundred and sixty-six
men, against that in which he knew Modred was; and having
opened a way with their swords, they pierced quite through
it, and made a grievous slaughter. For in this assault fell
the wicked traitor himself, and many thousands with him.
But notwithstanding the loss of him, the rest did not flee,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
but running together from all parts of the field maintained
their ground with undaunted courage. The fight now
grew more furious than ever, and proved fatal to almost all
the commanders and their forces. For on Modred's side fell
Cheldric, Elasius, Egbrict, and Bunignus, Saxons; Gillapatric,
Gillamor, Gistafel, and Gillarius, Irish; also the
Scots and Picts, with almost all their leaders: on Arthur's
side, Olbrict, king of Norway; Aschillius, king of Dacia;
Cador Limenic Cassibellaun, with many thousands of others, as
well Britons as foreigners, that he had brought with him.
And even the renowned king Arthur himself was mortally
wounded; and being carried thence to the isle of Avallon to
be cured of his wounds, he gave up the crown of Britain to
his kinsman Constantine, the son of Cador, duke of Cornwall,
in the five hundred and forty-second year of our Lord's
incarnation.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. III.</span>&mdash;<i>Constantine meets with disturbances from the Saxons and
Modred's sons.</i></h3>


<p>Upon Constantine's advancement to the throne, the Saxons,
with the two sons of Modred, made insurrection against him,
though without success; for after many battles they fled,
one to London, the other to Winchester, and possessed themselves
of those places. Then died Saint Daniel, the pious
prelate of the church of Bangor; and Theon, bishop of
Gloucester, was elected archbishop of London. At the
same time also died David, the pious archbishop of Legions,
at the city of Menevia, in his own abbey; which he loved
above all the other monasteries of his diocese, because Saint
Patrick, who had prophetically foretold his birth, was the
founder of it. For during his residence there among his
friars, he was taken with a sudden illness, of which he
died, and, at the command of Malgo, king of the Venedotians,
was buried in that church. He was succeeded in
the metropolitan see by Cynoc, bishop of the church of
Llan-Patern, who was thus promoted to a higher dignity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>

<p>But Constantine pursued the Saxons, and reduced them
under his yoke. He also took the two sons of Modred;
and one of them, who had fled for sanctuary to the church
of St. Amphibalus, in Winchester, he murdered before the
altar. The other had hidden himself in a convent of friars
at London, but at last was found out by him, brought before
the altar, and there put to death. Three years after this, he
himself, by the vengeance of God pursuing him, was killed by
Conan, and buried close by Uther Pendragon within the
structure of stones, which was set up with wonderful art not far
from Salisbury, and called in the English tongue, Stonehenge.</p>

the whole island, would have been worthy the crown of
it, had he not delighted in civil war. He raised disturbances
against his uncle, who ought to have reigned after
Constantine, and cast him into prison; and then killing his

sodomy, by which he made himself abominable to God. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. VIII.</span>&mdash;<i>Britain, in the flame of a civil war under king Careticus, is
miserably wasted by the Saxons and Africans.</i></h3>


<p>After Malgo succeeded Careticus, a lover of civil war, and
hateful to God and to the Britons. The Saxons, discovering
his fickle disposition, went to Ireland for Gormund, king of
the Africans, who had arrived there with a very great
fleet, and had subdued that country. From thence, at
their traitorous instigation, he sailed over into Britain,
which the perfidious Saxons in one part, in another the
Britons by their continual wars among themselves were
wholly laying waste. Entering therefore into alliance
with the Saxons, he made war upon king Careticus, and
after several battles fought, drove him from city to city, till
at length he forced him to Cirencester, and there besieged
him. Here Isembard, the nephew of Lewis, king of the
Franks, came and made a league of amity with him, and out
of respect to him renounced the Christian faith, on condition
that he would assist him to gain the kingdom of Gaul from
his uncle, by whom, he said, he was forcibly and unjustly
expelled out of it. At last, after taking and burning the
city, he had another fight with Careticus, and made him flee
beyond the Severn into Wales. He then made an utter
devastation of the country, set fire to the adjacent cities,
and continued these outrages until he had almost burned
up the whole surface of the island from the one sea to
the other; so that the tillage was everywhere destroyed,
and a general destruction made of the husbandmen and
clergy, with fire and sword. This terrible calamity caused
the rest to flee whithersoever they had any hopes of
safety.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. IX.</span>&mdash;<i>The author upbraids the Britons.</i></h3>


<p>"Why foolish nation! oppressed with the weight of your
abominable wickedness, why did you, in your insatiable
thirst after civil wars, so weaken yourself by domestic confusions,
that whereas formerly you brought distant kingdoms
under your yoke, now, like a good vineyard degenerated and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
turned to bitterness, you cannot defend your country, your
wives, and children, against your enemies? Go on, go on
in your civil dissensions, little understanding the saying in
the Gospel, 'Every kingdom divided against itself shall be
brought to desolation, and a house divided against itself shall
fall.' Since then your kingdom was divided against itself;
since the rage of civil discord, and the fumes of envy, have
darkened your minds, since your pride would not suffer you
to pay obedience to one king; you see, therefore, your country
made desolate by impious pagans, and your houses falling
one upon another; which shall be the cause of lasting sorrow
to your posterity. For the barbarous lionesses shall see
their whelps enjoying the towns, cities, and other possessions
of your children; from which they shall be miserably expelled,
and hardly if ever recover their former flourishing
state."</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. X.</span>&mdash;<i>Loegria is again inhabited by the Saxons. The Britons, with
their bishops, retire into Cornwall and Wales.</i></h3>


<p>But to return to the history; when the inhuman tyrant,
with many thousands of his Africans, had made a devastation
almost over the whole island, he yielded up the greater part
of it, called Loegria, to the Saxons, whose villainy had been
the occasion of his arrival. Therefore the remainder of the
Britons retired into the western parts of the kingdom, that
is, Cornwall and Wales; from whence they continually
made frequent and fierce irruptions upon the enemy. The
three archbishops, viz. the archbishop of Legions, Theon of
London, and Thadiocus of York, when they beheld all the
churches in their jurisdiction lying level with the ground,
fled with all the clergy that remained after so great a destruction,
to the coverts of the woods in Wales, carrying
with them the relics of the saints, for fear the sacred bones
of so many holy men of old might be destroyed by the barbarians,
if they should leave them in that imminent danger,
and themselves instantly suffer martyrdom. Many more
went over in a great fleet into Armorican Britain; so that
the whole church of the two provinces, Loegria and Northumberland,
had its convents destroyed. But these things I
shall relate elsewhere, when I translate the book concerning
their banishment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XI.</span>&mdash;<i>The Britons lose their kingdom.</i></h3>


<p>For a long time after this the Britons were dispossessed
of the crown of the kingdom, and the monarchy of the
island, and made no endeavours to recover their ancient
dignity; but even that part of the country which yet
remained to them, being subject not to one king, but three
tyrants, was often wasted by civil wars. But neither did
the Saxons yet obtain the crown, but were also subject to
three kings, who harassed sometimes one another, sometimes
the Britons.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XII.</span>&mdash;<i>Augustine, being sent by pope Gregory into Britain,
preaches the gospel to the Angles.</i></h3>


<p>In the meantime Augustine was sent by pope Saint Gregory
into Britain, to preach the word of God to the Angles, who,
being blinded with pagan superstition, had entirely extinguished
Christianity in that part of the island which they
possessed. But among the Britons, the Christian faith still
flourished, and never failed among them from the time of
pope Eleutherius, when it was first planted here. But when
Augustine came, he found in their province seven bishoprics
and an archbishopric, all filled with most devout prelates, and
a great number of abbeys; by which the flock of Christ was
still kept in good order. Among the rest, there was in the
city of Bangor a most noble church, in which it is reported
there was so great a number of monks, that when the
monastery was divided into seven parts, having each their
priors over them, not one of them had less than three
hundred monks, who all lived by the labour of their own
hands. The name of their abbat was Dinooth, a man
admirably skilled in the liberal arts; who, when Augustine
required the subjection of the British bishops, and would
have persuaded them to undertake the work of the gospel
with him among the Angles, answered him with several
arguments, that they owed no subjection to him, neither
would they preach to their enemies; since they had their
own archbishop, and because the Saxon nation persisted in
depriving them of their country. For this reason they
esteemed them their mortal enemies, reckoned their faith<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
and religion as nothing, and would no more communicate
with the Angles than with dogs.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XIII.</span>&mdash;<i>Ethelfrid kills a great number of the British monks, but is
at last routed by the Britons.</i></h3>


<p>Therefore Ethelbert, king of Kent, when he saw that the
Britons disdained subjection to Augustine, and despised his
preaching, was highly provoked, and stirred up Ethelfrid,
king of the Northumbrians, and the other petty kings of the
Saxons, to raise a great army, and march to the city of
Bangor, to destroy the abbat Dinooth, and the rest of the
clergy who held them in contempt. At his instigation,
therefore, they assembled a prodigious army, and in their
march to the province of the Britons, came to Legecester,
where Brocmail, consul of the city, was awaiting their
coming. To the same city were come innumerable monks
and hermits from several provinces of the Britons, but
especially from the city of Bangor, to pray for the safety
of their people. Whereupon Ethelfrid, king of the Northumbrians,
collecting all his forces, joined battle with
Brocmail, who, having a less army to withstand him, at
last quitted the city and fled, though not without having
made a great slaughter of the enemy. But Ethelfrid, when
he had taken the city, and understood upon what occasion
the monks were come thither, commanded his men to turn
their arms first against them; and so two hundred of them
were honoured with the crown of martyrdom, and admitted
into the kingdom of heaven that same day. From thence
this Saxon tyrant proceeded on his march to Bangor; but
upon the news of his outrageous madness, the leaders of the
Britons, viz. Blederic, duke of Cornwall, Margadud, king
of the Demetians, and Cadwan, of the Venedotians, came
from all parts to meet him, and joining battle with him,
wounded him, and forced him to flee; and killed of his
army to the number of ten thousand and sixty-six men. On
the Britons' side fell Blederic, duke of Cornwall, who was
their commander in those wars.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>

<h3>BOOK XII.</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. I.</span>&mdash;<i>Cadwan acquires by treaty all Britain on this side of the Humber,
and Ethelfrid the rest.</i></h3>


<p>After this all the princes of the Britons met together at
the city of Legecester, and consented to make Cadwan their
king, that under his command they might pursue Ethelfrid
beyond the Humber. Accordingly, as soon as he was
crowned, they flocked together from all parts, and passed the
Humber; of which when Ethelfrid received intelligence, he
entered into a confederacy with all the Saxon kings, and
went to meet Cadwan. At last, as they were forming their
troops for a battle, their friends came, and made peace
between them on these terms: that Cadwan should enjoy
that part of Britain which lies on this side of the Humber, and
Ethelfrid that which is beyond it. As soon as they had
confirmed this agreement with an oath made to their
hostages, there commenced such a friendship between them,
that they had all things common. In the meantime it
happened, that Ethelfrid banished his own wife and married
another, and bore so great a hatred to her that was banished,
that he would not suffer her to live in the kingdom of
Northumberland. Whereupon she, being with child, went
to king Cadwan, that by his mediation she might be restored
to her husband. But when Ethelfrid could by no means be
brought to consent to it, she continued to live with Cadwan,
till she was delivered of the son which she had conceived.
A short time after her delivery, Cadwan also had a son born
to him by the queen, his wife. Then were the two boys
brought up together in a manner suitable to their royal
birth, one of which was called Cadwalla, the other Edwin.
When they were nearly arrived at men's estate, their parents
sent them to Salomon, king of the Armorican Britons, that
in his court they might learn the discipline of war, and other
princely qualifications. This prince, therefore, received them
graciously, and admitted them to an intimacy with him; so
that there was none of their age in the whole court, that had
a free access, or more familiarly discoursed with the king
than they. At last he himself was an eye-witness of their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
exploits against the enemy, in which they very much signalized
their valour.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. II.</span>&mdash;<i>Cadwalla breaks the covenant he had made with Edwin.</i></h3>


<p>In process of time, when their parents were dead, they
returned to Britain, where they took upon them the
government of the kingdom, and began to form the same
friendship as their fathers. Two years after this, Edwin
asked leave of Cadwalla to wear a crown, and to celebrate
the same solemnities, as had been used of old in Northumberland.
And when they had begun a treaty upon this
subject by the river Duglas, that the matter might be
adjusted according to the advice of their wise counsellors,
it happened that Cadwalla was lying on the other side of the
river in the lap of a certain nephew of his, whose name was
Brian. While ambassadors were negotiating between them,
Brian wept, and shed tears so plentifully, that the king's face
and beard were wet with them. The king, imagining that
it rained, lifted up his face, and seeing the young man in
tears, asked him the occasion of such sudden grief. "Good
reason," said he, "have I to weep continually, as well as the
whole British nation, which has groaned under the oppression
of barbarians ever since the time of Malgo, and has not yet
got a prince, to restore it to its ancient flourishing state. And
even the little honour that it had left, is lessened by your
indulgence; since the Saxons, who are only strangers, and
always traitors to our country, must now be permitted to
wear the same crown as you do. For when once they shall
attain to regal dignity, it will be a great addition to their
glory in the country from whence they came; and they will
the sooner invite over their countrymen, for the utter extirpation
of our race. For they have been always accustomed
to treachery, and never to keep faith with any; which I
think should be a reason for our keeping them under, and
not for exalting them. When king Vortigern first retained
them in his service, they made a show of living peaceably,
and fighting for our country, till they had an opportunity of
practising their wickedness; and then they returned evil for
good, betrayed him, and made a cruel massacre of the people
of the kingdom. Afterwards they betrayed Aurelius Am<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>brosius,
to whom, even after the most tremendous oaths
of fidelity, at a banquet with him they gave a draught
of poison. They also betrayed Arthur, when, setting aside
the covenant by which they were bound, they joined with
his nephew Modred, and fought against him. Lastly, they
broke faith with king Careticus, and brought upon him
Gormund, king of the Africans, by whose disturbances our
people were robbed of their country, and the king disgracefully
driven out."</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. III.</span>&mdash;<i>A quarrel between Cadwalla and Edwin.</i></h3>


<p>At the mention of these things, Cadwalla repented of entering
into this treaty, and sent word to Edwin that he could
by no means induce his counsellors to consent to his petition.
For they alleged that it was contrary to law and the ancient
establishment, that an island, which has always had no more
than one crown, should be now under subjection to two
crowned heads. This message incensed Edwin, and made
him break off the conference, and retire into Northumberland,
saying, he would be crowned without Cadwalla's
leave. When Cadwalla was told this, he declared to him
by his ambassadors that he would cut off his crowned head,
if he presumed to wear a crown within the kingdom of
Britain.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. IV.</span>&mdash;<i>Cadwalla is vanquished by Edwin, and driven out of the
kingdom.</i></h3>


<p>This proved the occasion of a war between them, in which,
after several engagements between their men, they at last
met together themselves beyond the Humber, and had a
battle, wherein Cadwalla lost many thousands of his followers,
and was put to flight.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> From hence he marched
with precipitation through Albania, and went over to Ireland.
But Edwin, after this victory, led his army through the provinces
of the Britons, and burning the cities before him, grievously
afflicted the citizens and country people. During this
exercise of his cruelty, Cadwalla never ceased endeavouring
to return back to his country in a fleet, but without success;
because to whatever port he steered, Edwin met him with
his forces, and hindered his landing. For there was come to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
him from Spain a very skilful soothsayer, named Pellitus,
who, by the flight of birds and the courses of the stars,
foretold all the disasters that would happen. By these
means Edwin, getting knowledge of Cadwalla's return, prepared
to meet him, and shattered his ships so that he drowned
his men, and beat him off from all his ports. Cadwalla, not
knowing what course to take, was almost in despair of ever
returning. At last it came into his head to go to Salomon,
king of the Armorican Britons, and desire his assistance and
advice, to enable him to return to his kingdom. And so, as
he was steering towards Armorica, a strong tempest rose on
a sudden, which dispersed the ships of his companions, and
in a short time left no two of them together. The pilot of
the king's ship was seized immediately with so great a fear,
that quitting the stern, he left the vessel to the disposal of
fortune; so that all that night it was tossed up and down in
great danger by the raging waves. The next morning they
arrived at a certain island called Garnareia, where with
great difficulty they got ashore. Cadwalla was forthwith
seized with such grief for the loss of his companions, that
for three days and nights together he refused to eat, but lay
sick upon his bed. The fourth day he was taken with a very
great longing for some venison, and causing Brian to be
called, made him acquainted with it. Whereupon Brian
took his bow and quiver, and went through the island, that
if he could light on any wild beast, he might make booty of
it. And when he had walked over the whole island without
finding what he was in quest of, he was extremely concerned
that he could not gratify his master's desire; and was afraid
his sickness would prove mortal if his longing were not
satisfied. He, therefore, fell upon a new device, and cut a
piece of flesh out of his own thigh, which he roasted upon a
spit, and carried to the king for venison. The king, thinking
it to be real venison, began to eat of it to his great refreshment,
admiring the sweetness of it, which he fancied
exceeded any flesh he ever had tasted before. At last, when
he had fully satisfied his appetite, he became more cheerful,
and in three days was perfectly well again. Then the wind
standing fair, he got ready his ship, and hoisting sails
they pursued their voyage, and arrived at the city Kidaleta.
From thence they went to king Salomon, by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
whom they were received kindly and with all suitable respect;
and as soon as he had learned the occasion of their
coming, he made them a promise of assistance, and spoke to
them as follows.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. V.</span>&mdash;<i>The speech of Salomon, king of Armorica, to Cadwalla.</i></h3>


<p>"It is a grief to us, noble youths, that the country of your
ancestors is oppressed by a barbarous nation, and that you
are ignominiously driven out of it. But since other men are
able to defend their kingdoms, it is a wonder your people
should lose so fruitful an island, and not be able to withstand
the nation of the Angles, whom our countrymen hold
in contempt. While the people of this country lived together
with yours in Britain, they bore sway over all the provincial
kingdoms, and never could be subdued by any nation
but the Romans. Neither did the Romans do this by their
own power, as I have been lately informed, but by a dissension
among the nobility of the island. And even the
Romans, though they held it under their subjection for a
time, yet upon the loss and slaughter of their rulers, were
driven out with disgrace. But after the Britons came into
this province under the conduct of Maximian and Conan,
those that remained never had the happiness afterwards of
holding an uninterrupted possession of the crown. For
though many of their princes maintained the ancient dignity
of their ancestors, yet their weak heirs that succeeded,
though more in number, entirely lost it, upon the invasion
of their enemies. Therefore I am grieved for the weakness
of your people, since we are of the same race with you, and
the name of Britons is common to you, and to the nation that
bravely defends their country, which you see at war with all
its neighbours."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. VI.</span>&mdash;<i>Cadwalla's answer to Salomon.</i></h3>


<p>When he had concluded his speech, Cadwalla, who was a
little put to the blush, answered him after this manner:
"Royal sir, whose descent is from a race of kings, I give
you many thanks for your promise of assisting me to recover
my kingdom. But what you say is a wonder, that my people
have not maintained the dignity of their ancestors, since the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
time that the Britons came to these provinces, I am far from
thinking to be such. For the noblest men of the whole
kingdom followed those leaders, and there remained only the
baser sort to enjoy their honours; who being raised to a
high quality, on a sudden were puffed up above their station;
and growing wanton with riches gave themselves up to
commit such fornication as is not so much as named among the
Gentiles; and (as Gildas the historian testifies) were not only
guilty of this vice, but of all the enormities that are incident
to human nature. And what chiefly prevailed, to the entire
overthrow of all goodness, was the hatred of truth with its
assertors, the love of a lie with the inventors of it, the embracing
of evil for good, the veneration of wickedness for
grace, the receiving of Satan for an angel of light. Kings
were anointed, not for the sake of God, but such as were
more cruel than the rest; and were soon after murdered by
their anointers, without examination, having chosen others
yet more cruel in their room. But if any of them showed
any mildness, or seemed a favourer of truth, against him, as
the subverter of Britain, were all their malice and their
weapons bent. In short, things pleasing to God or displeasing,
with them had the same weight, even if the worse were
not the weightier. Therefore were all affairs managed contrary
to public safety, as if the true physician of all had left
them destitute of cure. And thus was every thing done
without discretion, and that not only by secular men, but by
the Lord's flock and its pastors. Therefore it is not to be
wondered, that such a degenerate race, so odious to God for
their vices, lost a country which they had so heinously corrupted.
For God was willing to execute his vengeance upon
them, by suffering a foreign people to come upon them, and
drive them out of their possessions. Notwithstanding it
would be a worthy act, if God would permit it, to restore
our subjects to their ancient dignity, to prevent the reproach
that may be thrown upon our race, that we were weak
rulers, who did not exert ourselves in our own defence.
And I do the more freely ask your assistance, as you are of
the same blood with us. For the great Malgo, who was the
fourth king of Britain after Arthur, had two sons, named
Enniaunus and Runo. Enniaunus begot Belin; Belin, Jago;
Jago, Cadwan, who was my father. Runo, who, after his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
brother's death, was driven out by the Saxons, came to this
province and bestowed his daughter on duke Hoel, the son
of that great Hoel who shared with Arthur in his conquests.
Of her was born Alan; of Alan, Hoel your father, who
while he lived was a terror to all Gaul."</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. VII.</span>&mdash;<i>Brian kills Edwin's magician.</i></h3>


<p>In the meantime, while he was spending the winter with
Salomon, they entered into a resolution, that Brian should
pass over into Britain, and take some method to kill Edwin's
magician, lest he might by his usual art inform him of Cadwalla's
coming. And when with this design he had arrived
at Hamo's Port, he took upon him the habit of a poor man,
and made himself a staff of iron sharp at the end, with
which he might kill the magician if he should happen to
meet with him. From thence he went to York, where Edwin
then resided; and having entered that city joined himself
to the poor people that waited for alms before the king's
gate. But as he was going to and fro, it happened that his
sister came out of the hall, with a basin in her hand, to
fetch water for the queen. She had been taken by Edwin
at the city of Worcester, when after Cadwalla's flight he
was acting his hostilities upon the provinces of the Britons.
As she was therefore passing by Brian, he immediately knew
her, and, breaking forth into tears, called to her with a low
voice; at which the damsel turning her face, was in doubt at
first who it could be, but upon a nearer approach discovered
it to be her brother, and was near falling into a swoon, for
fear that he might by some unlucky accident be known and
taken by the enemy. She therefore refrained from saluting
him, or entering into familiar discourse with him, but told
him, as if she was talking upon some other subject, the
state of the court, and showed him the magician, that he
was inquiring for, who was at that very time walking among
the poor people, while the alms were being distributed
among them. Brian, as soon as he had taken knowledge of
the man, ordered his sister to steal out privately from her
apartment the night following, and come to him near an old
church without the city, where he would conceal himself in
expectation of her. Then dismissing her, he thrust himself
in among the crowd of poor people, in that part where Pel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>litus
was placing them. And the same moment he got
access to him, he lifted up his staff, and at once gave him a
stab under the breast which killed him. This done, he threw
away his staff, and passed among the rest undistinguished
and unsuspected by any of the by-standers, and by good providence
got to the place of concealment which he had appointed.
His sister, when night came on, endeavoured all
she could to get out, but was not able; because Edwin, being
terrified at the killing of Pellitus, had set a strict watch
about the court, who, making a narrow search, refused to let
her go out. When Brian found this, he retired from that
place, and went to Exeter, where he called together the
Britons, and told them what he had done. Afterwards having
despatched away messengers to Cadwalla, he fortified
that city, and sent word to all the British nobility, that they
should bravely defend their cities and towns, and joyfully
expect Cadwalla's coming to their relief in a short time with
auxiliary forces from Salomon. Upon the spreading of this
news over the whole island, Penda, king of the Mercians,
with a very great army of Saxons, came to Exeter, and besieged
Brian.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. VIII.</span>&mdash;<i>Cadwalla takes Penda, and routs his army.</i></h3>


<p>In the meantime Cadwalla arrived with ten thousand men,
whom king Salomon had delivered to him; and with them
he marched straight to the siege against king Penda. But,
as he was going, he divided his forces into four parts, and
then made no delay to advance and join battle with the
enemy, wherein Penda was forthwith taken, and his army
routed. For, finding no other way for his own safety, he
surrendered himself to Cadwalla, and gave hostages, with a
promise that he would assist him against the Saxons. Cadwalla,
after this success against him, summoned together his
nobility, that had been a long time in a decaying state, and
marched to Northumberland against Edwin, and made continual
devastations in that country. When Edwin was informed
of it, he assembled all the petty kings of the Angles,
and meeting the Britons in a field called Heathfield,<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> presently

with him, together with Osfrid, his son, and Godbold, king
of the Orkneys, who had come to their assistance.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. IX.</span>&mdash;<i>Cadwalla kills Osric and Aidan in fight.</i></h3>


<p>Having thus obtained the victory, Cadwalla marched through
the provinces of the Angles, and committed such outrages
upon the Saxons, that he neither spared age nor sex; for his
resolution being to extirpate the whole race out of Britain,
all that he found he put to extreme tortures. After this he
had a battle with Osric, Edwin's successor, and killed him
together with his two nephews, who ought to have reigned
after him. He also killed Aidan, king of the Scots, who
came to their assistance.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. X.</span>&mdash;<i>Oswald routs Penda in fight, but is killed by Cadwalla coming

<p>Their deaths made room for Oswald to succeed to the kingdom
of Northumberland; but Cadwalla drove him, with the
rest that had given him disturbance, to the very wall which
the emperor Severus had formerly built between Britain and
Scotland. Afterwards he sent Penda, king of the Mercians,
and the greatest part of his army, to the same place, to give
him battle. But Oswald, as he was besieged one night by
Penda, in the place called Heavenfield, that is, the Heavenly
Field,<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> set up there our Lord's cross, and commanded his
men to speak with a very loud voice these words: "Let us
all kneel down, and pray the Almighty, living and true
God, to defend us from the proud army of the king of Britain,
and his wicked leader Penda. For he knows how justly we
wage this war for the safety of our people." They all therefore
did as he commanded them, and advanced at break of
day against the enemy, and by their faith gained the victory.
Cadwalla, upon hearing this news, being inflamed with rage,
assembled his army, and went in pursuit of the holy king
Oswald; and in a battle which he had with him at a place
called Burne, Penda broke in upon him and killed him.</p>

<p>Oswald, with many thousands of his men, being killed, his
brother Oswy succeeded him in the kingdom of Northumber<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>land,<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>
and by making large presents of gold and silver to
Cadwalla, who was now possessed of the government of all
Britain, made his peace and submission to him. Upon this
Alfrid, his brother, and Ethelwald,<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> his brother's son, began
an insurrection; but, not being able to hold out against him,
they fled to Penda, king of the Mercians, desiring him to
assemble his army and pass the Humber with them, that he
might deprive Oswy of his kingdom. But Penda, fearing to
break the peace, which Cadwalla had settled through the
kingdom of Britain, deferred beginning any disturbance without
his leave, till he could some way work him up, either to
make war himself upon Oswy, or allow him the liberty of
doing it. At a certain Pentecost therefore, when Cadwalla
was celebrating that festival at London, and for the greater
solemnity wore the crown of Britain, all the kings of the
Angles, excepting only Oswy, being present, as also all the
dukes of the Britons; Penda went to the king, and inquired
of him the reason, why Oswy alone was wanting, when all
the princes of the Saxons were present. Cadwalla answered,
that his sickness was the cause of it; to which the other
replied, that he had sent over to Germany for more Saxons,
to revenge the death of his brother Oswald upon them both.
He told him further, that he had broken the peace of the
kingdom, as being the sole author of the war and dissension
among them; since Ethelfrid, king of Northumberland, and
Ethelwald, his brother's son, had been by him harassed with
a war, and driven out of their own country. He also desired
leave, either to kill him, or banish him the kingdom.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XII.</span>&mdash;<i>Cadwalla is advised to suffer Penda to make an insurrection
against Oswy.</i></h3>


<p>This matter caused the king to enter upon much deliberation,
and hold a private consultation with his intimate friends,
what course to take. Among the rest that offered their proposals,
Margadud, king of the Dimetians, spoke as follows:&mdash;"Royal
sir, since you have proposed to expel the race of
the Angles from the coasts of Britain, why do you alter your
resolution, and suffer them to continue in peace among us?
At least you should permit them to fall out among them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>selves,
and let our country owe its deliverance to their own
civil broils. No faith is to be kept with one that is treacherous,
and is continually laying snares for him to whom he
owes fidelity. Such have the Saxons always been to our
nation, from the very first time of their coming among us.
What faith ought we to keep with them? Let Penda immediately
have leave to go against Oswy, that by this civil dissension
and destruction of one another, our island may get
rid of them."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XIII.</span>&mdash;<i>Penda is killed by Oswy. Cadwalla dies.</i></h3>


<p>By these and other words to the same effect, Cadwalla was
prevailed upon to grant the permission desired. And Penda,
having assembled a vast army, went to the Humber, and
laying waste that country, began a fierce war upon the king.
Oswy was at last reduced to such extremity, that he was
forced to promise him innumerable royal ornaments, and
other presents more than one would believe, if he would
desist from ruining his country, and return home without
committing any more hostilities. But when the other could
by no entreaties be prevailed upon to do it, the king, in hopes
of divine assistance, though he had a less army, however,
gave him battle near the River Winwid, and having killed
Penda and thirty other commanders, gained the victory.
Penda's son Wulfred, by a grant from Cadwalla, succeeded
to the kingdom, and joining with Eafa and Eadbert, two
leaders of the Mercians, rebelled against Oswy; but at last,
by Cadwalla's command, made peace with him. At length,
after forty-eight years were expired, that most noble and
potent king of the Britons, Cadwalla, being grown infirm with
age and sickness, departed this life upon the fifteenth before
the kalends of December. The Britons embalmed his body,
and placed it with wonderful art in a brazen statue, which
was cast according to the measure of his stature. This
statue they set up with complete armour, on an admirable and
beautiful brazen horse, over the western gate of London, for
a monument of the above-mentioned victory, and for a terror
to the Saxons. They also built under it a church in honour
of St. Martin, in which divine ceremonies are celebrated for
him and the others who departed in the faith.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

whom Bede calls the youth Elidwalda. At first he maintained
the government with peace and honour; but after
twelve years' enjoyment of the crown, he fell into a fit of
sickness, and a civil war broke out among the Britons. His
mother was Penda's sister, by the same father but a different
mother, descended from the noble race of the Gewisseans.
For Cadwalla, after his reconciliation with her brother, made
her the partner of his bed, and had Cadwallader by her.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XV.</span>&mdash;<i>The Britons are compelled, by pestilence and famine, to leave
Britain. Cadwallader's lamentation.</i></h3>


<p>During his sickness, the Britons, (as we said before,) quarrelling
among themselves, made a wicked destruction of a
rich country; and this again was attended with another misfortune.
For this besotted people was punished with a
grievous and memorable famine; so that every province was
destitute of all sustenance, except what could be taken in
hunting. After the famine followed a terrible pestilence,
which in a short time destroyed such multitudes of people,
that the living were not sufficient to bury the dead. Those
of them that remained, flying their country in whole troops
together, went to the countries beyond the sea, and while
they were under sail, they with a mournful howling voice
sang, "Thou hast given us, O God, like sheep appointed for
meat, and hast scattered us among the heathen." Also Cadwallader
himself, in his voyage, with his miserable fleet to
Armorica, made this addition to the lamentation, "Woe to
us sinners, for our grievous impieties, wherewith we have
not ceased to provoke God, while we had space for repentance.
Therefore the revenge of his power lies heavy upon
us, and drives us out of our native soil, which neither the
Romans of old, nor the Scots or Picts afterwards, nor yet
the treacherous Saxons with all their craft, were able to do.
But in vain have we recovered our country so often from
them; since it was not the will of God that we should per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>petually
hold the government of it. He who is the true Judge,
when he saw we were by no means to be reclaimed from our
wickedness, and that no human power could expel our race,
was willing to chastise our folly himself; and has turned his
anger against us, by which we are driven out in crowds
from our native country. Return, therefore, ye Romans;
return, Scots and Picts; return, Ambrons and Saxons: behold,
Britain lies open to you, being by the wrath of God
made desolate, which you were never able to do. It is not
your valour that expels us; but the power of the supreme
King, whom we have never ceased to provoke."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XVI.</span>&mdash;<i>Cadwallader with his people goes to Alan. The Saxons
seize all Britain.</i></h3>


<p>With these dolorous complaints he arrived at the Armorican
coast, and went with his whole company to king Alan, the
nephew of Salomon by whom he was honourably received. So
that Britain, being now destitute of its ancient inhabitants, excepting
a few in Wales that escaped the general mortality,
became a frightful place even to the Britons themselves for
eleven years after. Neither was it at the same time more
favourable to the Saxons, who died in it without intermission.
Notwithstanding the remainder of them, after this raging
plague was ceased, according to their old custom sent word
over to their countrymen, that the island of Britain was now
freed of its native inhabitants, and lay open to them, if they
would come over and inhabit it. As soon as they had received
this information, that odious people, gathering together
an innumerable multitude of men and women, arrived in
Northumberland, and inhabited the provinces that lay desolate
from Albania to Cornwall. For there was now nobody
to hinder them, excepting the poor remains of the Britons,
who continued together in the thickets of the woods in Wales.
From that time the power of the Britons ceased in the island,
and the Angles began their reign.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XVII.</span>&mdash;<i>Cadwallader is by the voice of an angel deterred from
returning to Britain.</i></h3>


<p>After some time, when the people had recovered strength,
Cadwallader, being mindful of his kingdom, which was now
free from the contagion of the pestilence, desired assistance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
of Alan towards the recovery of his dominions. The king
granted his request; but as he was getting ready a fleet, he
was commanded by the loud voice of an angel to desist from
his enterprise. For God was not willing that the Britons
should reign any longer in the island, before the time came of
which Merlin prophetically foretold Arthur. It also commanded
him to go to Rome to pope Sergius, where, after
doing penance, he should be enrolled among the saints. It
told him withal, that the Britons, by the merit of their faith,
should again recover the island, when the time decreed for
it was come. But this would not be accomplished before
they should be possessed of his reliques, and transport them
from Rome into Britain. At the same time also the reliques
of the other saints should be found, which had been hidden
on account of the invasion of pagans; and then at last would
they recover their lost kingdom. When the holy prince had
received the heavenly message, he went straight to king Alan,
and gave him an account of what had been told him.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XVIII.</span>&mdash;<i>Cadwallader goes to Rome and dies.</i></h3>


<p>Then Alan had recourse to several books, as the prophecies
of the eagle that prophesied at Shaftesbury, and the verses
of Sibyl and Merlin; and made diligent search in them, to
see whether the revelation made to Cadwallader agreed with
those written oracles. And when he could find nothing
contradictory to it, he admonished Cadwallader to submit to
the divine dispensation, and laying aside the thoughts of
Britain, perform what the angelical voice had commanded
him. But he urged him to send his son Ivor and his nephew
Ini over into the island, to govern the remainder of the
Britons; lest a nation, descended of so ancient a race, should
lose their liberty by the incursions of barbarians. Then
Cadwallader, renouncing worldly cares for the sake of God
and his everlasting kingdom, went to Rome, and was confirmed
by pope Sergius: and being seized with a sudden illness,
was, upon the twelfth before the kalends of May, in the
six hundred and eighty-ninth year of our Lord's incarnation
freed from the corruption of the flesh, and admitted into the
glories of the heavenly kingdom.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. XIX.</span>&mdash;<i>The two Britons, Ivor and Ini, in vain attack the nation
of the Angles. Athelstan the first king of the Angles.</i></h3>


<p>As soon as Ivor and Ini had got together their ships, they
with all the forces they could raise, arrived in the island, and
for forty-nine years together fiercely attacked the nation of
the Angles, but to little purpose. For the above-mentioned
mortality and famine, together with the inveterate spirit of
faction that was among them, had made this proud people so
much degenerate, that they were not able to gain any advantage
of the enemy. And being now also overrun with barbarism,
they were no longer called Britons, but Gualenses,
Welshmen; a word derived either from Gualo their leader,
or Guales their queen, or from their barbarism. But the
Saxons managed affairs with more prudence, maintained
peace and concord among themselves, tilled their grounds,
rebuilt their cities and towns, and so throwing off the dominion
of the Britons, bore sway over all Loegria, under their
leader Athelstan, who first wore a crown amongst them.
But the Welshmen, being very much degenerated from the
nobility of the Britons, never after recovered the monarchy
of the island; on the contrary, by quarrels among themselves,
and wars with the Saxons, their country was a perpetual
scene of misery and slaughter.</p>

that God's people, for breaking the law of God, save two
only, were slain by wild beasts, by fire and sword in the
deserts of Arabia, though God had so loved them that he
had made a way for them through the Red Sea, had fed
them with bread from heaven, and water from the rock, and
by the lifting up of a hand merely had made their armies
invincible; and then, when they had crossed the Jordan
and entered the unknown land, and the walls of the city
had fallen down flat at the sound only of a trumpet, the
taking of a cloak and a little gold from the accursed things
caused the deaths of many: and again the breach of their
treaty with the Gibeonites, though that treaty had been
obtained by fraud, brought destruction upon many; and I
took warning from the sins of the people which called down
upon them the reprehensions of the prophets and also of
Jeremiah, with his fourfold Lamentations written in alphabetic
order. I saw moreover in my own time, as that prophet
also had complained, that the city had sat down lone and
widowed, which before was full of people; that the queen
of nations and the princess of provinces (<i>i.e.</i> the church),
had been made tributary; that the gold was obscured, and
the most excellent colour (which is the brightness of God's
word) changed; that the sons of Sion (<i>i.e.</i> of holy mother
church), once famous and clothed in the finest gold, grovelled
in dung; and what added intolerably to the weight of grief
of that illustrious man, and to mine, though but an abject
whilst he had thus mourned them in their happy and
prosperous condition, "Her Nazarites were fairer than
snow, more ruddy than old ivory, more beautiful than the
sapphire." These and many other passages in the ancient
Scriptures I regarded as a kind of mirror of human life, and
I turned also to the New, wherein I read more clearly what
perhaps to me before was dark, for the darkness fled, and
truth shed her steady light&mdash;I read therein that the Lord
had said, "I came not but to the lost sheep of the house
of Israel;" and on the other hand, "But the children of this
kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness; there shall
be weeping and gnashing of teeth:" and again, "It is not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
good to take the children's meat and to give it to dogs:"
also, "Woe to you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites!" I
heard how "many shall come from the east and the west,
and shall sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the
kingdom of heaven:" and on the contrary, "I will then say
to them, 'Depart from me, ye workers of iniquity!'" I
read, "Blessed are the barren, and the teats which have not
given suck;" and on the contrary, "Those, who were ready,
entered with him to the wedding; afterwards came the other
virgins also, saying 'Lord, Lord, open to us:' to whom it
was answered, 'I do not know you.'" I heard, forsooth,
"Whoever shall believe and be baptized, shall be saved,
but whoever shall not believe shall be damned." I read
in the words of the apostle that the branch of the wild
olive was grafted upon the good olive, but should nevertheless
be cut off from the communion of the root of its
fatness, if it did not hold itself in fear, but entertained
lofty thoughts. I knew the mercy of the Lord, but I also
feared his judgment: I praised his grace, but I feared the
rendering to every man according to his works: perceiving
the sheep of the same fold to be different, I deservedly commended
Peter for his entire confession of Christ, but called
Judas most wretched, for his love of covetousness: I thought
Stephen most glorious on account of the palm of martyrdom,
but Nicholas wretched for his mark of unclean heresy: I
read assuredly, "They had all things common:" but likewise
also, as it is written, "Why have ye conspired to tempt the
Spirit of God?" I saw, on the other hand, how much
security had grown upon the men of our time, as if there
were nothing to cause them fear. These things, therefore,
and many more which for brevity's sake we have determined
to omit, I revolved again and again in my amazed mind with
compunction in my heart, and I thought to myself, "If God's
peculiar people, chosen from all the people of the world, the
royal seed, and holy nation, to whom he had said, 'My first-begotten
Israel,' its priests, prophets, and kings, throughout
so many ages, his servant and apostle, and the members of
his primitive church, were not spared when they deviated
from the right path, what will he do to the darkness of this
our age, in which, besides all the huge and heinous sins,
which it has in common with all the wicked of the world<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
committed, is found an innate, indelible, and irremediable
load of folly and inconstancy?" "What, wretched man (I
say to myself) is it given to you, as if you were an illustrious
and learned teacher, to oppose the force of so violent a
torrent, and keep the charge committed to you against such
a series of inveterate crimes which has spread far and wide,
without interruption, for so many years? Hold thy peace:
to do otherwise, is to tell the foot to see, and the hand to
speak. Britain has rulers, and she has watchmen: why dost
thou incline thyself thus uselessly to prate?" She has such,
I say, not too many, perhaps, but surely not too few: but,
because they are bent down and pressed beneath so heavy a
burden, they have not time allowed them to take breath.
My senses, therefore, as if feeling a portion of my debt and
obligation, preoccupied themselves with such objections, and
with others yet more strong. They struggled, as I said, no
short time, in a fearful strait, whilst I read, "There is a time
for speaking, and a time for keeping silence." At length,
the creditor's side prevailed and bore off the victory: if
(said he) thou art not bold enough to be marked with the
comely mark of golden liberty among the prophetic creatures,
who enjoy the rank as reasoning beings next to the angels,
refuse not the inspiration of the understanding ass, to that
day dumb, which would not carry forward the tiara'd magician
who was going to curse God's people, but in the narrow
pass of the vineyard crushed his loosened foot, and thereby
felt the lash; and though he was, with his ungrateful and
furious hand, against right justice, beating her innocent
sides, she pointed out to him the heavenly messenger holding
the naked sword, and standing in his way, though he had not
seen him.]</p>

<p>Wherefore in zeal for the house of God and for his holy
law, constrained either by the reasonings of my own thoughts,
or by the pious entreaties of my brethren, I now discharge
the debt so long exacted of me; humble, indeed, in style,
but faithful, as I think, and friendly to all Christ's youthful
soldiers, but severe and insupportable to foolish apostates;
the former of whom, if I am not deceived, will receive the
same with tears flowing from God's love; but the others with
sorrow, such as is extorted from the indignation and pusillanimity
of a convicted conscience.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p>&sect; 2. I will, therefore, if God be willing, endeavour to say
a few words about the situation of Britain, her disobedience
and subjection, her rebellion, second subjection and dreadful
slavery&mdash;of her religion, persecution, holy martyrs, heresies
of different kinds&mdash;of her tyrants, her two hostile and
ravaging nations&mdash;of her first devastation, her defence, her
second devastation and second taking vengeance&mdash;of her
third devastation, of her famine, and the letters to Agitius<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>&mdash;of
her victory and her crimes&mdash;of the sudden rumour of
enemies&mdash;of her famous pestilence&mdash;of her counsels&mdash;of her
last enemy, far more cruel than the first&mdash;of the subversion
of her cities, and of the remnant that escaped; and finally,
of the peace which, by the will of God, has been granted her
in these our times.</p>

<h3>II. THE HISTORY.</h3>


<p>&sect; 3. The island of Britain, situated on almost the utmost
border of the earth, towards the south and west, and poised
in the divine balance, as it is said, which supports the whole
world, stretches out from the south-west towards the north
pole, and is eight hundred miles long and two hundred
broad,<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> except where the headlands of sundry promontories
stretch farther into the sea. It is surrounded by the ocean,
which forms winding bays, and is strongly defended by
this ample, and, if I may so call it, impassable barrier, save
on the south side, where the narrow sea affords a passage to
Belgic Gaul. It is enriched by the mouths of two noble
rivers, the Thames and the Severn, as it were two arms, by
which foreign luxuries were of old imported, and by other
streams of less importance. It is famous for eight and
twenty cities, and is embellished by certain castles, with
walls, towers, well barred gates, and houses with threatening
battlements built on high, and provided with all requisite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
instruments of defence. Its plains are spacious, its hills are
pleasantly situated, adapted for superior tillage, and its
mountains are admirably calculated for the alternate pasturage
of cattle, where flowers of various colours, trodden by
the feet of man, give it the appearance of a lovely picture.
It is decked, like a man's chosen bride, with divers jewels,
with lucid fountains and abundant brooks wandering over
the snow white sands; with transparent rivers, flowing in
gentle murmurs, and offering a sweet pledge of slumber<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> to
those who recline upon their banks, whilst it is irrigated
by abundant lakes, which pour forth cool torrents of refreshing
water.</p>

<p>&sect; 4. This island, stiff-necked and stubborn-minded, from
the time of its being first inhabited, ungratefully rebels,
sometimes against God, sometimes against her own citizens,
and frequently, also, against foreign kings and their subjects.
For what can there either be, or be committed, more disgraceful
or more unrighteous in human affairs, than to refuse
to show fear to God or affection to one's own countrymen, and
(without detriment to one's faith) to refuse due honour to
those of higher dignity, to cast off all regard to reason,
human and divine, and, in contempt of heaven and earth, to
be guided by one's own sensual inventions? I shall, therefore,
omit those ancient errors common to all the nations of
the earth, in which, before Christ came in the flesh, all mankind
were bound; nor shall I enumerate those diabolical
idols of my country, which almost surpassed in number
those of Egypt, and of which we still see some mouldering
away within or without the deserted temples, with stiff and
deformed features as was customary. Nor will I call out upon
the mountains, fountains, or hills, or upon the rivers, which
now are subservient to the use of men, but once were an
abomination and destruction to them, and to which the blind
people paid divine honour. I shall also pass over the bygone
times of our cruel tyrants, whose notoriety was spread
over to far distant countries; so that Porphyry, that dog who
in the east was always so fierce against the church, in his mad
and vain style added this also, that "Britain is a land fertile<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
in tyrants."<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> I will only endeavour to relate the evils
which Britain suffered in the times of the Roman emperors,
and also those which she caused to distant states; but so far
as lies in my power, I shall not follow the writings and
records of my own country, which (if there ever were any
of them) have been consumed in the fires of the enemy, or
have accompanied my exiled countrymen into distant lands,
but be guided by the relations of foreign writers, which,
being broken and interrupted in many places, are therefore
by no means clear.</p>

<p>&sect; 5. For when the rulers of Rome had obtained the
empire of the world, subdued all the neighbouring nations
and islands towards the east, and strengthened their renown
by the first peace which they made with the Parthians, who
border on India, there was a general cessation from war
throughout the whole world; the fierce flame which they
kindled could not be extinguished or checked by the Western
Ocean, but passing beyond the sea, imposed submission upon
our island without resistance, and entirely reduced to obedience
its unwarlike but faithless people, not so much by fire
and sword and warlike engines, like other nations, but threats
alone, and menaces of judgments frowning on their countenance,
whilst terror penetrated to their hearts.</p>

<p>&sect; 6. When afterwards they returned to Rome, for want
of pay, as is said, and had no suspicion of an approaching
rebellion, that deceitful lioness (Boadicea) put to death the
rulers who had been left among them, to unfold more fully
and to confirm the enterprises of the Romans. When
the report of these things reached the senate, and they
with a speedy army made haste to take vengeance on the
crafty foxes,<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> as they called them, there was no bold navy
on the sea to fight bravely for the country; by land there
was no marshalled army, no right wing of battle, nor other
preparation for resistance; but their backs were their shields
against their vanquishers, and they presented their necks to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
their swords, whilst chill terror ran through every limb,
and they stretched out their hands to be bound, like women;
so that it has become a proverb far and wide, that the
Britons are neither brave in war nor faithful in time of
peace.</p>

<p>&sect; 7. The Romans, therefore, having slain many of the
rebels, and reserved others for slaves, that the land might
not be entirely reduced to desolation, left the island, destitute
as it was of wine and oil, and returned to Italy, leaving behind
them taskmasters, to scourge the shoulders of the natives, to
reduce their necks to the yoke, and their soil to the vassalage
of a Roman province; to chastise the crafty race, not with
warlike weapons, but with rods, and if necessary to gird
upon their sides the naked sword, so that it was no longer
thought to be Britain, but a Roman island; and all their
money, whether of copper, gold, or silver, was stamped with
C&aelig;sar's image.</p>

<p>&sect; 8. Meanwhile these islands, stiff with cold and frost,
and in a distant region of the world, remote from the visible
sun, received the beams of light, that is, the holy precepts
of Christ, the true Sun, showing to the whole world his
splendour, not only from the temporal firmament, but from
the height of heaven, which surpasses every thing temporal,
at the latter part, as we know, of the reign of Tiberius
C&aelig;sar, by whom his religion was propagated without impediment,
and death threatened to those who interfered with
its professors.</p>

<p>&sect; 9. These rays of light were received with lukewarm
minds by the inhabitants, but they nevertheless took root
among some of them in a greater or less degree, until the
nine years' persecution of the tyrant Diocletian, when the
churches throughout the whole world were overthrown, all
the copies of the Holy Scriptures which could be found
burned in the streets, and the chosen pastors of God's flock
butchered, together with their innocent sheep, in order that
not a vestige, if possible, might remain in some provinces of
Christ's religion. What disgraceful flights then took place&mdash;what
slaughter and death inflicted by way of punishment
in divers shapes,&mdash;what dreadful apostacies from religion;
and on the contrary, what glorious crowns of martyrdom
then were won,&mdash;what raving fury was displayed by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
persecutors, and patience on the part of the suffering saints,
ecclesiastical history informs us; for the whole church were
crowding in a body, to leave behind them the dark things
of this world, and to make the best of their way to the
happy mansions of heaven, as if to their proper home.</p>

<p>&sect; 10. God, therefore, who wishes all men to be saved, and
who calls sinners no less than those who think themselves
righteous, magnified his mercy towards us, and, as we know,
during the above-named persecution, that Britain might not
totally be enveloped in the dark shades of night, he, of his
own free gift, kindled up among us bright luminaries of holy
martyrs, whose places of burial and of martyrdom, had they
not for our manifold crimes been interfered with and destroyed
by the barbarians, would have still kindled in the
minds of the beholders no small fire of divine charity. Such
were St. Alban of Verulam, Aaron and Julius, citizens of
Carlisle,<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> and the rest, of both sexes, who in different places
stood their ground in the Christian contest.</p>

<p>&sect; 11. The first of these martyrs, St. Alban, for charity's
sake saved another confessor who was pursued by his persecutors,
and was on the point of being seized, by hiding him
in his house, and then by changing clothes with him, imitating
in this the example of Christ, who laid down his life
for his sheep, and exposing himself in the other's clothes to
be pursued in his stead. So pleasing to God was this conduct,
that between his confession and martyrdom, he was
honoured with the performance of wonderful miracles in
presence of the impious blasphemers who were carrying the
Roman standards, and like the Israelites of old, who trod
dry-foot an unfrequented path whilst the ark of the covenant
stood some time on the sands in the midst of Jordan;
so also the martyr, with a thousand others, opened a path
across the noble river Thames, whose waters stood abrupt
like precipices on either side; and seeing this, the first of
his executors was stricken with awe, and from a wolf became
a lamb; so that he thirsted for martyrdom, and boldly underwent
that for which he thirsted. The other holy martyrs
were tormented with divers sufferings, and their limbs were
racked in such unheard of ways, that they, without delay,
erected the trophies of their glorious martyrdom even in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
gates of the city of Jerusalem. For those who survived,
hid themselves in woods and deserts, and secret caves,
waiting until God, who is the righteous judge of all, should
reward their persecutors with judgment, and themselves with
protection of their lives.</p>

<p>&sect; 12. In less than ten years, therefore, of the above-named
persecution, and when these bloody decrees began to
fail in consequence of the death of their authors, all Christ's
young disciples, after so long and wintry a night, begin to
behold the genial light of heaven. They rebuild the
churches, which had been levelled to the ground; they
found, erect, and finish churches to the holy martyrs, and
everywhere show their ensigns as token of their victory;
festivals are celebrated and sacraments received with clean
hearts and lips, and all the church's sons rejoice as it were
in the fostering bosom of a mother. For this holy union
remained between Christ their head and the members of his
church, until the Arian treason, fatal as a serpent, and vomiting
its poison from beyond the sea, caused deadly dissension between
brothers inhabiting the same house, and thus, as if a road
were made across the sea, like wild beasts of all descriptions,
and darting the poison of every heresy from their jaws, they
inflicted dreadful wounds upon their country, which is ever
desirous to hear something new, and remains constant long
to nothing.</p>

<p>&sect; 13. At length also, new races of tyrants sprang up, in
terrific numbers, and the island, still bearing its Roman
name, but casting off her institutes and laws, sent forth
among the Gauls that bitter scion of her own planting
Maximus, with a great number of followers, and the ensigns
of royalty, which he bore without decency and without lawful
right, but in a tyrannical manner, and amid the disturbances
of the seditious soldiery. He, by cunning arts rather
than by valour, attaching to his rule, by perjury and falsehood,
all the neighbouring towns and provinces, against the
Roman state, extended one of his wings to Spain, the other
to Italy, fixed the seat of his unholy government at Treves,
and so furiously pushed his rebellion against his lawful
emperors that he drove one of them out of Rome, and caused
the other to terminate his most holy life. Trusting to these
successful attempts, he not long after lost his accursed head<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
before the walls of Aquileia, whereas he had before cut off
the crowned heads of almost all the world.</p>

<p>&sect; 14. After this, Britain is left deprived of all her soldiery
and armed bands, of her cruel governors, and of the flower
of her youth, who went with Maximus, but never again returned;
and utterly ignorant as she was of the art of war,
groaned in amazement for many years under the cruelty of
two foreign nations&mdash;the Scots from the north-west, and the
Picts from the north.</p>

<p>&sect; 15. The Britons, impatient at the assaults of the Scots
and Picts, their hostilities and dreadful oppressions, send ambassadors
to Rome with letters, entreating in piteous terms
the assistance of an armed band to protect them, and offering
loyal and ready submission to the authority of Rome, if they
only would expel their invading foes. A legion is immediately
sent, forgetting their past rebellion, and provided
sufficiently with arms. When they had crossed over the sea
and landed, they came at once to close conflict with their
cruel enemies, and slew great numbers of them. All of
them were driven beyond the borders, and the humiliated
natives rescued from the bloody slavery which awaited them.
By the advice of their protectors, they now built a wall
across the island from one sea to the other, which being
manned with a proper force, might be a terror to the foes
whom it was intended to repel, and a protection to their
friends whom it covered. But this wall, being made of turf
instead of stone, was of no use to that foolish people, who
had no head to guide them.</p>

<p>&sect; 16. The Roman legion had no sooner returned home in
joy and triumph, than their former foes, like hungry and
ravening wolves, rushing with greedy jaws upon the fold
which is left without a shepherd, and wafted both by the
strength of oarsmen and the blowing wind, break through
the boundaries, and spread slaughter on every side, and like
mowers cutting down the ripe corn, they cut up, tread under
foot, and overrun the whole country.</p>

<p>&sect; 17. And now again they send suppliant ambassadors,
with their garments rent and their heads covered with ashes,
imploring assistance from the Romans, and like timorous
chickens, crowding under the protecting wings of their
parents, that their wretched country might not altogether be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
destroyed, and that the Roman name, which now was but
an empty sound to fill the ear, might not become a reproach
even to distant nations. Upon this, the Romans, moved
with compassion, as far as human nature can be, at the
relations of such horrors, send forward, like eagles in their
flight, their unexpected bands of cavalry by land and mariners
by sea, and planting their terrible swords upon the
shoulders of their enemies, they mow them down like leaves
which fall at the destined period; and as a mountain-torrent
swelled with numerous streams, and bursting its banks with
roaring noise, with foaming crest and yeasty wave rising to
the stars, by whose eddying currents our eyes are as it were
dazzled, does with one of its billows overwhelm every obstacle
in its way, so did our illustrious defenders vigorously drive
our enemies' band beyond the sea, if any could so escape them;
for it was beyond those same seas that they transported, year
after year, the plunder which they had gained, no one daring
to resist them.</p>

<p>&sect; 18. The Romans, therefore, left the country, giving
notice that they could no longer be harassed by such
laborious expeditions, nor suffer the Roman standards, with
so large and brave an army, to be worn out by sea and land
by fighting against these unwarlike, plundering vagabonds;
but that the islanders, inuring themselves to warlike weapons,
and bravely fighting, should valiantly protect their country,
their property, wives and children, and, what is dearer than
these, their liberty and lives; that they should not suffer
their hands to be tied behind their backs by a nation which,
unless they were enervated by idleness and sloth, was not
more powerful than themselves, but that they should arm
those hands with buckler, sword, and spear, ready for the
field of battle; and, because they thought this also of
advantage to the people they were about to leave, they,
with the help of the miserable natives, built a wall different
from the former, by public and private contributions, and
of the same structure as walls generally, extending in a
straight line from sea to sea, between some cities, which,
from fear of their enemies, had there by chance been built.
They then give energetic counsel to the timorous natives,
and leave them patterns by which to manufacture arms.
Moreover, on the south coast where their vessels lay, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
there was some apprehension lest the barbarians might
land, they erected towers at stated intervals, commanding
a prospect of the sea; and then left the island never to
return.</p>

<p>&sect; 19. No sooner were they gone, than the Picts and Scots,
like worms which in the heat of mid-day come forth from
their holes, hastily land again from their canoes, in which
they had been carried beyond the Cichican<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> valley, differing
one from another in manners, but inspired with the same
avidity for blood, and all more eager to shroud their villainous
faces in bushy hair than to cover with decent clothing those
parts of their body which required it. Moreover, having
heard of the departure of our friends, and their resolution
never to return, they seized with greater boldness than before
on all the country towards the extreme north as far as the
wall. To oppose them there was placed on the heights a
garrison equally slow to fight and ill adapted to run away, a
useless and panic-struck company, who slumbered away
days and nights on their unprofitable watch. Meanwhile
the hooked weapons of their enemies were not idle, and our
wretched countrymen were dragged from the wall and dashed
against the ground. Such premature death, however, painful
as it was, saved them from seeing the miserable sufferings of
their brothers and children. But why should I say more?
They left their cities, abandoned the protection of the wall,
and dispersed themselves in flight more desperately than
before. The enemy, on the other hand, pursued them with
more unrelenting cruelty than before, and butchered our
countrymen like sheep, so that their habitations were like
those of savage beasts; for they turned their arms upon
each other, and for the sake of a little sustenance, imbrued
their hands in the blood of their fellow countrymen. Thus
foreign calamities were augmented by domestic feuds; so
that the whole country was entirely destitute of provisions,
save such as could be procured in the chase.</p>

<p>&sect; 20. Again, therefore, the wretched remnant, sending to
&AElig;tius, a powerful Roman citizen, address him as follows:&mdash;"To
&AElig;tius,<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> now consul for the third time: the groans of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
the Britons." And again a little further, thus:&mdash;"The
barbarians drive us to the sea: the sea throws us back
on the barbarians: thus two modes of death await us, we
are either slain or drowned." The Romans, however, could
not assist them, and in the meantime the discomfited people,
wandering in the woods, began to feel the effects of a severe
famine, which compelled many of them without delay to
yield themselves up to their cruel persecutors, to obtain
subsistence: others of them, however, lying hid in mountains,
caves, and woods, continually sallied out from thence
to renew the war. And then it was, for the first time, that
they overthrew their enemies, who had for so many years
been living in their country; for their trust was not in man,
but in God; according to the maxim of Philo, "We must
have divine assistance, when that of man fails." The boldness
of the enemy was for a while checked, but not the
wickedness of our countrymen: the enemy left our people,
but the people did not leave their sins.</p>

<p>&sect; 21. For it has always been a custom with our nation, as
it is at present, to be impotent in repelling foreign foes, but
bold and invincible in raising civil war, and bearing the
burdens of their offences: they are impotent, I say, in
following the standard of peace and truth, but bold in
wickedness and falsehood. The audacious invaders therefore
return to their winter quarters, determined before long
again to return and plunder. And then, too, the Picts for
the first time seated themselves at the extremity of the island,
where they afterwards continued, occasionally plundering and
wasting the country. During these truces, the wounds of
the distressed people are healed, but another sore, still more
venomous, broke out. No sooner were the ravages of the
enemy checked, than the island was deluged with a most
extraordinary plenty of all things, greater than was before
known, and with it grew up every kind of luxury and
licentiousness. It grew with so firm a root, that one might
truly say of it, "Such fornication is heard of among you, as
never was known the like among the Gentiles." But besides
this vice, there arose also every other, to which human nature
is liable, and in particular that hatred of truth, together with
her supporters, which still at present destroys every thing
good in the island; the love of falsehood, together with its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
inventors, the reception of crime in the place of virtue, the
respect shown to wickedness rather than goodness, the love
of darkness instead of the sun, the admission of Satan as an
angel of light. Kings were anointed, not according to God's
ordinance, but such as showed themselves more cruel than
the rest; and soon after, they were put to death by those
who had elected them, without any inquiry into their merits,
but because others still more cruel were chosen to succeed
them. If any one of these was of a milder nature than the
rest, or in any way more regardful of the truth, he was
looked upon as the ruiner of the country, every body cast a
dart at him, and they valued things alike whether pleasing
or displeasing to God, unless it so happened that what displeased
him was pleasing to themselves. So that the words
of the prophet, addressed to the people of old, might well be
applied to our own countrymen: "Children without a law,
have ye left God and provoked to anger the holy one of
Israel?<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> Why will ye still inquire, adding iniquity?
Every head is languid and every heart is sad; from the
sole of the foot to the crown, there is no health in him."
And thus they did all things contrary to their salvation, as
if no remedy could be applied to the world by the true
Physician of all men. And not only the laity did so, but
our Lord's own flock and its shepherds, who ought to have
been an example to the people, slumbered away their time in
drunkenness, as if they had been dipped in wine; whilst the
swellings of pride, the jar of strife, the griping talons of envy,
and the confused estimate of right and wrong, got such entire
possession of them, that there seemed to be poured out (and
the same still continueth) contempt upon princes, and to
be made by their vanities to wander astray and not in the
way.</p>

<p>&sect; 22. Meanwhile, God being willing to purify his family
who were infected by so deep a stain of woe, and at the
hearing only of their calamities to amend them; a vague
rumour suddenly as if on wings reaches the ears of all, that
their inveterate foes were rapidly approaching to destroy the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
whole country, and to take possession of it, as of old, from
one end to the other. But yet they derived no advantage
from this intelligence; for, like frantic beasts, taking the bit
of reason between their teeth, they abandoned the safe and
narrow road, and rushed forward upon the broad downward
path of vice, which leads to death. Whilst, therefore, as
Solomon says, the stubborn servant is not cured by words,
the fool is scourged and feels it not: a pestilential disease
mortally affected the foolish people, which, without the
sword, cut off so large a number of persons, that the living
were not able to bury them. But even this was no warning
to them, that in them also might be fulfilled the words of
Isaiah the prophet, "And God hath called his people to
lamentation, to baldness, and to the girdle of sackcloth;
behold they begin to kill calves, and to slay rams, to eat, to
drink, and to say, 'We will eat and drink, for to-morrow we
shall die.'" For the time was approaching, when all their
iniquities, as formerly those of the Amorrh&aelig;ans, should be
fulfilled. For a council was called to settle what was best
and most expedient to be done, in order to repel such
frequent and fatal irruptions and plunderings of the above
named nations.</p>

<p>&sect; 23. Then all the councillors, together with that proud tyrant
Gurthrigern [Vortigern], the British king, were so blinded,
that, as a protection to their country, they sealed its doom by
inviting in among them (like wolves into the sheepfold), the
fierce and impious Saxons, a race hateful both to God and
men, to repel the invasions of the northern nations. Nothing
was ever so pernicious to our country, nothing was
ever so unlucky. What palpable darkness must have enveloped
their minds&mdash;darkness desperate and cruel! Those
very people whom, when absent, they dreaded more than
death itself, were invited to reside, as one may say, under
the selfsame roof. Foolish are the princes, as it is said, of
Thafneos, giving counsel to unwise Pharaoh. A multitude
of whelps came forth from the lair of this barbaric lioness,
in three cyuls, as they call them, that is, in three ships of
war, with their sails wafted by the wind and with omens and
prophecies favourable, for it was foretold by a certain soothsayer
among them, that they should occupy the country to
which they were sailing three hundred years, and half of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
that time, a hundred and fifty years, should plunder and
despoil the same. They first landed on the eastern side of
the island, by the invitation of the unlucky king, and there
fixed their sharp talons, apparently to fight in favour of the
island, but alas! more truly against it. Their mother-land,
finding her first brood thus successful, sends forth a larger
company of her wolfish offspring, which sailing over, join
themselves to their bastard-born comrades. From that time
the germ of iniquity and the root of contention planted
their poison amongst us, as we deserved, and shot forth into
leaves and branches. The barbarians being thus introduced
as soldiers into the island, to encounter, as they falsely said,
any dangers in defence of their hospitable entertainers, obtain
an allowance of provisions, which, for some time being
plentifully bestowed, stopped their doggish mouths. Yet
they complain that their monthly supplies are not furnished
in sufficient abundance, and they industriously aggravate
each occasion of quarrel, saying that unless more liberality
is shown them, they will break the treaty and plunder the
whole island. In a short time, they follow up their threats
with deeds.</p>

<p>&sect; 24. For the fire of vengeance, justly kindled by former
crimes, spread from sea to sea, fed by the hands of our foes
in the east, and did not cease, until, destroying the neighbouring
towns and lands, it reached the other side of the
island, and dipped its red and savage tongue in the western
ocean. In these assaults, therefore, not unlike that of the
Assyrian upon Judea, was fulfilled in our case what the prophet
describes in words of lamentation: "They have burned
with fire the sanctuary; they have polluted on earth the
tabernacle of thy name." And again, "O God, the gentiles
have come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they
defiled," &amp;c. So that all the columns were levelled with
the ground by the frequent strokes of the battering-ram, all
the husbandmen routed, together with their bishops, priests,
and people, whilst the sword gleamed, and the flames
crackled around them on every side. Lamentable to behold,
in the midst of the streets lay the tops of lofty towers,
tumbled to the ground, stones of high walls, holy altars,
fragments of human bodies, covered with livid clots of coagulated
blood, looking as if they had been squeezed together in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
a press;<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> and with no chance of being buried, save in the
ruins of the houses, or in the ravening bellies of wild beasts
and birds; with reverence be it spoken for their blessed
souls, if, indeed, there were many found who were carried,
at that time, into the high heaven by the holy angels. So
entirely had the vintage, once so fine, degenerated and become
bitter, that, in the words of the prophet, there was
hardly a grape or ear of corn to be seen where the husbandman
had turned his back.</p>

<p>&sect; 25. Some, therefore, of the miserable remnant, being
taken in the mountains, were murdered in great numbers;
others, constrained by famine, came and yielded themselves
to be slaves for ever to their foes, running the risk of being
instantly slain, which truly was the greatest favour that
could be offered them: some others passed beyond the seas
with loud lamentations instead of the voice of exhortation.
"Thou hast given us as sheep to be slaughtered, and among
the Gentiles hast thou dispersed us." Others, committing
the safeguard of their lives, which were in continual jeopardy,
to the mountains, precipices, thickly wooded forests, and
to the rocks of the seas (albeit with trembling hearts),
remained still in their country. But in the meanwhile, an
opportunity happening, when these most cruel robbers were
returned home, the poor remnants of our nation (to whom
flocked from divers places round about our miserable countrymen
as fast as bees to their hives, for fear of an ensuing
storm), being strengthened by God, calling upon him with
all their hearts, as the poet says,&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left:6em;">
"With their unnumbered vows they burden heaven,"<br />
</p>

<p>that they might not be brought to utter destruction, took
arms under the conduct of Ambrosius Aurelianus, a modest
man, who of all the Roman nation was then alone in the
confusion of this troubled period by chance left alive. His
parents, who for their merit were adorned with the purple,
had been slain in these same broils, and now his progeny in
these our days, although shamefully degenerated from the
worthiness of their ancestors, provoke to battle their cruel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
conquerors, and by the goodness of our Lord obtain the
victory.</p>

<p>&sect; 26. After this, sometimes our countrymen, sometimes
the enemy, won the field, to the end that our Lord might in
this land try after his accustomed manner these his Israelites,
whether they loved him or not, until the year of the siege of
Bath-hill, when took place also the last almost, though not
the least slaughter of our cruel foes, which was (as I am
sure) forty-four years and one month after the landing of the
Saxons, and also the time of my own nativity. And yet
neither to this day are the cities of our country inhabited as
before, but being forsaken and overthrown, still lie desolate;
our foreign wars having ceased, but our civil troubles still
remaining. For as well the remembrance of such a terrible
desolation of the island, as also of the unexpected recovery
of the same, remained in the minds of those who were eye-witnesses
of the wonderful events of both, and in regard
thereof, kings, public magistrates, and private persons, with
priests and clergymen, did all and every one of them live
orderly according to their several vocations. But when
these had departed out of this world, and a new race succeeded,
who were ignorant of this troublesome time, and had
only experience of the present prosperity, all the laws of
truth and justice were so shaken and subverted, that not so
much as a vestige or remembrance of these virtues remained
among the above-named orders of men, except among a very
few who, compared with the great multitude which were
daily rushing headlong down to hell, are accounted so small
a number, that our reverend mother, the church, scarcely
beholds them, her only true children, reposing in her bosom;
whose worthy lives, being a pattern to all men, and beloved
of God, inasmuch as by their holy prayers, as by certain
pillars and most profitable supporters, our infirmity is sustained
up, that it may not utterly be broken down, I would
have no one suppose I intended to reprove, if forced by the
increasing multitude of offences, I have freely, aye, with anguish,
not so much declared as bewailed the wickedness of
those who are become servants, not only to their bellies, but
also to the devil rather than to Christ, who is our blessed
God, world without end.</p>

<p>For why shall their countrymen conceal what foreign na<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>tions
round about now not only know, but also continually
are casting in their teeth?</p>

<h3>III. THE EPISTLE.</h3>


<p>&sect; 27. Britain has kings, but they are tyrants; she has
judges, but unrighteous ones; generally engaged in plunder
and rapine, but always preying on the innocent; whenever
they exert themselves to avenge or protect, it is sure to be
in favour of robbers and criminals; they have an abundance
of wives, yet are they addicted to fornication and adultery;
they are ever ready to take oaths, and as often perjure
themselves; they make a vow and almost immediately act
falsely; they make war, but their wars are against their
countrymen, and are unjust ones; they rigorously prosecute
thieves throughout their country, but those who sit at table
with them are robbers, and they not only cherish but reward
them; they give alms plentifully, but in contrast to this is a
whole pile of crimes which they have committed; they sit
on the seat of justice, but rarely seek for the rule of right
judgment; they despise the innocent and the humble, but
seize every occasion of exalting to the utmost the bloody-minded;
the proud, murderers, the combined and adulterers,
enemies of God, who ought to be utterly destroyed and their
names forgotten.</p>

<p>They have many prisoners in their gaols, loaded with
chains, but this is done in treachery rather than in just
punishment for crimes; and when they have stood before
the altar, swearing by the name of God, they go away and
think no more of the holy altar than if it were a mere heap
of dirty stones.</p>

<p>&sect; 28. Of this horrid abomination, Constantine,<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> the
tyrannical whelp of the unclean lioness of Damnonia,<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> is
not ignorant.</p>

<p>This same year, after taking a dreadful oath (whereby he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
bound himself first before God, by a solemn protestation, and
then called all the saints, and Mother of God, to witness,
that he would not contrive any deceit against his countrymen),
he nevertheless, in the habit of a holy abbat amid the
sacred altars, did with sword and javelin, as if with teeth,
wound and tear, even in the bosoms of their temporal
mother, and of the church their spiritual mother, two royal
youths, with their two attendants, whose arms, although not
cased in armour, were yet boldly used, and, stretched out
towards God and his altar, will hang up at the gates of thy
city, O Christ, the venerable ensigns of their faith and
patience; and when he had done it, the cloaks, red with
coagulated blood, did touch the place of the heavenly
sacrifice. And not one worthy act could he boast of previous
to this cruel deed; for many years before he had
stained himself with the abomination of many adulteries,
having put away his wife contrary to the command of
Christ, the teacher of the world, who hath said: "What
God hath joined together, let not man separate," and again:
"Husbands, love your wives." For he had planted in the
ground of his heart (an unfruitful soil for any good seed) a
bitter scion of incredulity and folly, taken from the vine of
Sodom, which being watered with his vulgar and domestic
impieties, like poisonous showers, and afterwards audaciously
springing up to the offence of God, brought forth into the
world the sin of horrible murder and sacrilege; and not yet
discharged from the entangling nets of his former offences,
he added new wickedness to the former.</p>

<p>&sect; 29. Go to now, I reprove thee as present, whom I
know as yet to be in this life extant. Why standest thou
astonished, O thou butcher of thine own soul? Why dost
thou wilfully kindle against thyself the eternal fires of hell?
Why dost thou, in place of enemies, desperately stab thyself
with thine own sword, with thine own javelin? Cannot
those same poisonous cups of offences yet satisfy thy
stomach? Look back (I beseech thee) and come to Christ
(for thou labourest, and art pressed down to the earth with
this huge burden), and he himself, as he said, will give
thee rest. Come to him who wisheth not the death of a
sinner, but that he should be rather converted and live.
Unloose (according to the prophet) the bands of thy neck<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
O thou son of Sion. Return (I pray thee), although from
the far remote regions of sins, unto the most holy Father,
who, for his son that will despise the filthy food of swine,
and fear a death of cruel famine, and so come back to him
again, hath with great joy been accustomed to kill his fatted
calf, and bring forth for the wanderer, the first robe and
royal ring, and then taking as it were a taste of the heavenly
hope, thou shalt perceive how sweet our Lord is. For if
thou dost contemn these, be thou assured, thou shalt almost
instantly be tossed and tormented in the inevitable and dark
floods of endless fire.</p>

<p>&sect; 30. What dost thou also, thou lion's whelp (as the
prophet saith), Aurelius Conanus?<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> Art not thou as the
former (if not far more foul) to thy utter destruction,
swallowed up in the filthiness of horrible murders, fornications,
and adulteries, as by an overwhelming flood of the
sea? Hast not thou by hating, as a deadly serpent, the
peace of thy country, and thirsting unjustly after civil wars
and frequent spoil, shut the gates of heavenly peace and
repose against thine own soul? Being now left alone as a
withering tree in the midst of a field, remember (I beseech
thee) the vain and idle fancies of thy parents and brethren,
together with the untimely death that befell them in the
prime of their youth; and shalt thou, for thy religious
deserts, be reserved out of all thy family to live a hundred
years, or to attain to the age of a Methusalem? No, surely,
but unless (as the psalmist saith) thou shalt be speedily
converted unto our Lord, that King will shortly brandish his
sword against thee, who hath said by his prophet, "I will
kill, and I will cause to live; I will strike, and I will heal;
and there is no one who can deliver out of my hand." Be
thou therefore shaken out of thy filthy dust, and with all
thy heart converted to Him who hath created thee, that
"when his wrath shall shortly burn out, thou mayst be
blessed by fixing thy hopes on him." But if otherwise,
eternal pains will be heaped up for thee, where thou shalt be
ever tormented and never consumed in the cruel jaws of hell.</p>

<p>&sect; 31. Thou also, who like to the spotted leopard, art
diverse in manners and in mischief, whose head now is
growing grey, who art seated on a throne full of deceits, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
from the bottom even to the top art stained with murder and
adulteries, thou naughty son of a good king, like Manasses
sprung from Ezechiah, Vortipore, thou foolish tyrant of the
Demetians,<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> why art thou so stiff? What! do not such
violent gulfs of sin (which thou dost swallow up like
pleasant wine, nay rather which swallow thee up), as yet
satisfy thee, especially since the end of thy life is daily now
approaching? Why dost thou heavily clog thy miserable
soul with the sin of lust, which is fouler than any other, by
putting away thy wife, and after her honourable death, by
the base practices of thy shameless daughter? Waste not (I
beseech thee) the residue of thy life in offending God,
because as yet an acceptable time and day of salvation
shines on the faces of the penitent, wherein thou mayest
take care that thy flight may not be in the winter, or on the
sabbath day. "Turn away (according to the psalmist) from
evil, and do good, seek peace and ensue it," because the eyes
of our Lord will be cast upon thee, when thou doest righteousness,
and his ears will be then open unto thy prayers,
and he will not destroy thy memory out of the land of the
living; thou shalt cry, and he will hear thee, and out of thy
tribulations deliver thee; for Christ doth never despise a
heart that is contrite and humbled with fear of him.
Otherwise, the worm of thy torture shall not die, and the
fire of thy burning shall never be extinguished.</p>

<p>&sect; 32. And thou too, Cuneglasse,<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> why art thou fallen into
the filth of thy former naughtiness, yea, since the very first
spring of thy tender youth, thou bear, thou rider and ruler
of many, and guider of the chariot which is the receptacle
of the bear, thou contemner of God, and vilifier of his
order, thou tawny butcher, as in the Latin tongue thy name
signifies. Why dost thou raise so great a war as well
against men as also against God himself, against men, yea,
thy own countrymen, with thy deadly weapons, and against
God with thine infinite offences? Why, besides thine other
innumerable backslidings, having thrown out of doors thy
wife, dost thou, in the lust, or rather stupidity of thy mind,
against the apostle's express prohibition, denouncing that no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
adulterers can be partakers of the kingdom of heaven,
esteem her detestable sister, who had vowed unto God the
everlasting continency, as the very flower (in the language
of the poet) of the celestial nymphs? Why dost thou
provoke with thy frequent injuries the lamentations and
sighs of saints, by thy means corporally afflicted, which will
in time to come, like a fierce lioness, break thy bones in
pieces? Desist, I beseech thee (as the prophet saith) from
wrath, and leave off thy deadly fury, which thou breathest
out against heaven and earth, against God and his flock, and
which in time will be thy own torment; rather with altered
mind obtain the prayers of those who possess a power of
binding over this world, when in this world they bind the
guilty, and of loosing when they loose the penitent. Be not
(as the apostle saith) proudly wise, nor hope thou in the
uncertainty of riches, but in God who giveth thee many
things abundantly, and by the amendment of thy manners
purchase unto thyself a good foundation for hereafter, and
seek to enter into that real and true state of existence which
will be not transitory but everlasting. Otherwise, thou
shalt know and see, yea, in this very world, how bad and
bitter a thing it is for thee to leave the Lord thy God, and
not have his fear before thine eyes, and in the next, how
thou shalt be burned in the foul encompassing flames of
endless fire, nor yet by any manner of means shalt ever die.
For the souls of the sinful are as eternal in perpetual fire, as
the souls of the just in perpetual joy and gladness.</p>

<p>&sect; 33. And likewise, O thou dragon of the island, who
hast deprived many tyrants, as well of their kingdoms as of
their lives, and though the last-mentioned in my writing,
the first in mischief, exceeding many in power, and also in
malice, more liberal than others in giving, more licentious in
sinning, strong in arms, but stronger in working thine own
soul's destruction, Maglocune,<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> why art thou (as if soaked
in the wine of the Sodomitical grape) foolishly rolling in
that black pool of thine offences? Why dost thou wilfully
heap like a mountain, upon thy kingly shoulders, such a load
of sins? Why dost thou show thyself unto the King of kings
(who hath made thee as well in kingdom as in stature of body
higher than almost all the other chiefs of Britain) not better<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
likewise in virtues than the rest; but on the contrary for thy
sins much worse? Listen then awhile and hear patiently the
following enumeration of thy deeds, wherein I will not
touch any domestic and light offences (if yet any of them are
light) but only those open ones which are spread far and
wide in the knowledge of all men. Didst not thou, in the
very beginning of thy youth, terribly oppress with sword,
spear, and fire, the king thine uncle, together with his courageous
bands of soldiers, whose countenances in battle were
not unlike those of young lions? Not regarding the words
of the prophet, who says, "The blood-thirsty and deceitful
men shall not live out half their days;" and even if the
sequel of thy sins were not such as ensued, yet what retribution
couldst thou expect for this offence only at the hands of the
just Judge, who hath said by his prophet: "Woe be to thee
who spoilest, and shalt not thou thyself be spoiled? and thou
who killest, shalt not thyself be killed? and when thou shalt
make an end of thy spoiling, then shalt thou thyself fall."</p>

<p>&sect; 34. But when the imagination of thy violent rule had
succeeded according to thy wishes, and thou wast urged by a
desire to return into the right way, night and day the consciousness
of thy crimes afflicted thee, whilst thou didst
ruminate on the Lord's ritual and the ordinances of the
monks, and then publish to the world and vow thyself before
God a monk with no intention to be unfaithful, as thou didst
say, having burst through those toils in which such great
beasts as thyself were used to become entangled, whether it
were love of rule, of gold, or silver, or, what is stronger
still, the fancies of thy own heart. And didst thou not, as a
dove which cleaves the yielding air with its pinions, and by
its rapid turns escapes the furious hawk, safely return to the
cells where the saints repose, as a most certain place of
refuge? Oh how great a joy should it have been to our
mother church, if the enemy of all mankind had not lamentably
pulled thee, as it were, out of her bosom! Oh what an
abundant flame of heavenly hope would have been kindled in
the hearts of desperate sinners, hadst thou remained in thy
blessed estate! Oh what great rewards in the kingdom of
Christ would have been laid up for thy soul against the day
of judgment, if that crafty wolf had not caught thee, who of
a wolf wast now become a lamb (not much against thine own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
will) out of the fold of our Lord, and made thee of a lamb, a
wolf like unto himself, again? Oh how great a joy would
the preservation of thy salvation have been to God the
Father of all saints, had not the devil, the father of all castaways,
as an eagle of monstrous wings and claws, carried
thee captive away against all right and reason, to the unhappy
band of his children? And to be short, thy conversion
to righteousness gave as great joy to heaven and earth,
as now thy detestable return, like a dog to his vomit,
breedeth grief and lamentation: which being done, "the
members which should have been busily employed, as the
armour of justice for the Lord, are now become the armour
of iniquity for sin and the devil;" for now thou dost not
listen to the praises of God sweetly sounded forth by the
pleasant voices of Christ's soldiers, nor the instruments of
ecclesiastical melody, but thy own praises (which are nothing)
rung out after the fashion of the giddy rout of Bacchus by
the mouths of thy villainous followers, accompanied with lies
and malice, to the utter destruction of the neighbours; so
that the vessel prepared for the service of God, is now
turned to a vessel of dirt, and what was once reputed worthy
of heavenly honour, is now cast as it deserves into the
bottomless pit of hell.</p>

<p>&sect; 35. Yet neither is thy sensual mind (which is overcome
by the excess of thy follies) at all checked in its course with
committing so many sins, but hot and prone (like a young
colt that coveteth every pleasant pasture) runneth headlong
forward, with irrecoverable fury, through the intended fields
of crime, continually increasing the number of its transgressions.
For the former marriage of thy first wife
(although after thy violated vow of religion she was not
lawfully thine, but only by right of the time she was with
thee), was now despised by thee, and another woman, the
wife of a man then living, and he no stranger, but thy own
brother's son, enjoyed thy affections. Upon which occasion
that stiff neck of thine (already laden with sins) is now
burdened with two monstrous murders, the one of thy aforesaid
nephew, the other, of her who once was thy wedded wife:
and thou art now from low to lower, and from bad to worse,
bowed, bent, and sunk down into the lowest depth of sacrilege.
Afterwards, also didst thou publicly marry the widow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
by whose deceit and suggestion such a heavy weight of
offences was undergone, and take her, lawfully, as the flattering
tongues of thy parasites with false words pronounced it,
but as we say, most wickedly, to be thine own in wedlock.
And therefore what holy man is there, who, moved with the
narration of such a history, would not presently break out
into weeping and lamentations? What priest (whose heart
lieth open unto God) would not instantly, upon hearing this,
exclaim with anguish in the language of the prophet: "Who
shall give water to my head, and to my eyes a fountain of
tears, and I will day and night bewail those of my people,
who are slaughtered." For full little (alas!) hast thou with
thine ears listened to that reprehension of the prophet speaking
in this wise: "Woe be unto you, O wicked men, who
have left the law of the most holy God, and if ye shall be
born, your portion shall be to malediction, and if ye die, to
malediction shall be your portion, all things that are from
the earth, to the earth shall be converted again, so shall the
wicked from malediction pass to perdition:" if they return
not unto our Lord, listening to this admonition: "Son, thou
hast offended; add no further offence thereunto, but rather
pray for the forgiveness of the former." And again, "Be
not slow to be converted unto our Lord, neither put off the
same from day to day, for his wrath doth come suddenly."
Because, as the Scripture saith, "When the king heareth the
unjust word, all under his dominion become wicked." And,
the just king (according to the prophet) raiseth up his region.
But warnings truly are not wanting to thee, since thou hast
had for thy instructor the most eloquent master of almost all
Britain. Take heed, thereof, lest that which Solomon noteth,
befall thee, which is, "Even as he who stirreth up a sleeping
man out of his heavy sleep, so is that person who declareth
wisdom unto a fool, for in the end of his speech will
he say, What hast thou first spoken? Wash thine heart (as
it is written) from malice, O Jerusalem, that thou mayest
be saved." Despise not (I beseech thee) the unspeakable
mercy of God, calling by his prophet the wicked in this way
from their offences: "I will on a sudden speak to the
nation, and to the kingdom, that I may root out, and disperse,
and destroy, and overthrow." As for the sinner he
doth in this wise exhort him vehemently to repent. "And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
if the same people shall repent from their offence, I will also
repent of the evil which I have said that I would do unto
them." And again, "Who will give them such an heart,
that they may hear me, and keep my commandments, and
that it may be well with them all the days of their lives."
And also in the Canticle of Deuteronomy, "A people without
counsel and prudence, I wish they would be wise, and
understand, and foresee the last of all, how one pursueth a
thousand and two put to flight ten thousand." And again,
our Lord in the gospel, "Come unto me, all ye who do labour
and are burdened, and I will make you rest. Take my
yoke upon you, and learn of me, because I am meek and
humble of heart, and ye shall find repose for your souls."
For if thou turn a deaf ear to these admonitions, contemn
the prophets, and despise Christ, and make no account of us,
humble though we be, so long as with sincere piety and
purity of mind we bear in mind that saying of the prophet,
that we may not be found, "Dumb dogs, not able to bark;"
(however I for my part may not be of that singular fortitude,
in the spirit and virtue of our Lord, as to declare, "To the
house of Jacob their sins, and the house of Israel their
offences;") and so long as we shall remember that of Solomon,
"He who says that the wicked are just, shall be accursed
among the people, and odious to nations, for they who
reprove them shall have better hopes." And again, "Respect,
not with reverence thy neighbour in his ruin, nor forbear to
speak in time of salvation." And as long also as we forget
not this, "Root out those who are led to death, and forbear
not to redeem them who are murdered;" because, as the
same prophet says, "Riches shall not profit in the day of
wrath, but justice delivereth from death." And, "If the just
indeed be hardly saved, where shall the wicked and sinner
appear?" If, as I said, thou scorn us, who obey these texts,
the dark flood of hell shall without doubt eternally drown
thee in that deadly whirlpool, and those terrible streams of
fire that shall ever torment and never consume thee, and
then shall the confession of thy pains and sorrow for thy sins
be altogether too late and unprofitable to one, who now in this
accepted time and day of salvation deferreth his conversion
to a more righteous way of life.</p>

<p>&sect; 37. And here, indeed, if not before, was this lamentable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
history of the miseries of our time to have been brought to
a conclusion, that I might no further discourse of the deeds
of men; but that I may not be thought timid or weary,
whereby I might the less carefully avoid that saying of
Isaiah, "Woe be to them who call good evil, and evil good,
placing darkness for light, and light for darkness, bitter for
sweet, and sweet for bitter, who seeing see not, and hearing
hear not, whose hearts are overshadowed with a thick and
black cloud of vices;" I will briefly set down the threatenings
which are denounced against these five aforesaid lascivious
horses, the frantic followers of Pharaoh, through whom
his army is wilfully urged forward to their utter destruction
in the Red Sea, and also against such others, by the sacred
oracles, with whose holy testimonies the frame of this our
little work is, as it were, roofed in, that it may not be subject
to the showers of the envious, which otherwise would be
poured thereon. Let, therefore, God's holy prophets, who
are to mortal men the mouth of God, and the organ of the
Holy Ghost, forbidding evils, and favouring goodness, answer
for us as well now as formerly, against the stubborn
and proud princes of this our age, that they may not say we
menace them with such threats, and such great terrors of our
own invention only, and with rash and over-zealous meddling.
For to no wise man is it doubtful how far more grievous the
sins of this our time are than those of the primitive age,
when the apostle said, "Any one transgressing the law, being
convicted by two or three witnesses, shall die, how much
worse punishment think ye then that he deserveth, who shall
trample under his foot the Son of God?"</p>

<p>&sect; 38. And first of all appears before us, Samuel, by
God's commandment, the establisher of a lawful kingdom,
dedicated to God before his birth, undoubtedly known by
marvellous signs, to be a true prophet unto all the people,
from Dan even to Beersheba, out of whose mouth the Holy
Ghost thundereth to all the potentates of the world, denouncing
Saul the first king of the Hebrews, only because
he did not accomplish some matters commanded him of our
Lord, in these words which follow: "Thou hast done
foolishly, neither yet hast thou kept the commandments of
our Lord thy God, that he hath given thee in charge; which
if thou hadst not committed, even now had our Lord pre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>pared
thy reign over Israel for ever, but thy kingdom shall
no farther arise." And what did he commit, whether it
were adultery or murder, like to the offences of the present
time? No, truly, but broke in part one of God's commandments,
for, as one of our writers says, "The question is not
of the quality of the sin, but of the violating of the precept."
Also when he endeavoured to answer (as he thought)
the objections of Samuel, and after the fashion of men wisely
to make excuses for his offence in this manner: "Yea, I
have obeyed the voice of our Lord, and walked in the way
through which he hath sent me;" with this rebuke was he
corrected by him: "What! will our Lord have burnt offerings
or oblations, and not rather that the voice of our Lord
should be obeyed? Obedience is better than oblations, and
to hearken unto him, better than to offer the fat of rams.
For as it is the sin of soothsaying to resist, so is it the
offence of idolatry not to obey; in regard, therefore, that
thou hast cast away the word of our Lord, he hath also cast
thee away that thou be not king." And a little after, "Our
Lord hath this day rent the kingdom of Israel from thee,
and delivered it up to thy neighbour, a man better than thyself.
The Triumpher of Israel truly will not spare, and will not
be bowed with repentance, neither yet is he a man that he
should repent;" that is to say, upon the stony hearts of the
wicked: wherein it is to be noted how he saith, that to be
disobedient unto God is the sin of idolatry. Let not, therefore,
our wicked transgressors (while they do not openly
sacrifice to the gods of the Gentiles) flatter themselves that
they are not idolaters, whilst they tread like swine the most
precious pearls of Christ under their feet.</p>

<p>&sect; 39. But although this one example as an invincible
affirmation might abundantly suffice to correct the wicked;
yet, that by the mouths of many witnesses all the offences
of Britain may be proved, let us pass to the rest. What
happened to David for numbering his people, when the prophet
Gad spake unto him in this sort? Thus saith our
Lord: "The choice of three things is offered thee, choose
which thou wilt, that I may execute it upon thee. Shall
there befall thee a famine for seven years, or shalt thou flee
three months before thine enemies, and they pursue thee, or
shall there be three days' pestilence in thy land?" For be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>ing
brought into great straits by this condition, and willing
rather to fall into the hands of God who is merciful, than
into those of men, he was humbled with the slaughter of
seventy thousand of his subjects, and unless with the affection
of an apostolic charity, he had desired to die himself
for his countrymen, that the plague might not further consume
them, saying, "I am he that has offended, I the
shepherd have dealt unjustly: but these sheep, what have
they sinned? Let thy hand, I beseech thee, be turned
against me, and against the house of my father;" he would
have atoned for the unadvised pride of his heart with his
own death. For what does the scripture afterwards declare
of his son? "And Solomon wrought that which was not
pleasing before our Lord, and he did not fill up the measure
of his good deeds by following the Lord like his father
David. And our Lord said unto him, Because thou hast
thus behaved thyself, and not observed my covenant and
precepts, which I have commanded thee, breaking it asunder;
I will divide thy kingdom, and give the same unto thy
servant."</p>

<p>&sect; 40. Hear now likewise what fell upon the two sacrilegious
kings of Israel (even such as ours are), Jeroboam and
Baasha, unto whom the sentence and doom of our Lord is
by the prophet in this way directed: "For what cause have
I exalted thee a prince over Israel, in regard that they have
provoked me by their vanities. Behold I will stir up after
Baasha and after his house, and I will give over his house as
the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat. Whoso of his
blood shall die in the city, the dogs shall eat him, and the
dead carcass of him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of
the air eat." What doth he also threaten unto that wicked
king of Israel, a worthy companion of the former, by whose
collusion and his wife's deceit, innocent Naboth was for his
father's vineyard put to death, when the holy mouth of Elias,
yea, the selfsame mouth that was instructed with the fiery
speech of our Lord, thus spake unto him: "Hast thou killed
and also taken possession, and after this wilt thou yet add
more? Thus saith our Lord, in this very place, wherein
the dogs have licked the blood of Naboth, they shall lick up
thy blood also." Which fell out afterwards in that very
sort, as we have certain proof. But lest perchance (as befell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
Ahab also) the lying spirit, which pronounceth vain things
in the mouths of your prophets may seduce you, hearken
to the words of the prophet Micaiah: "Behold God hath
suffered the spirit of lying to possess the mouths of all thy
prophets that do here remain, and our Lord hath pronounced
evil against thee." For even now it is certain that there are
some teachers inspired with a contrary spirit, preaching and
affirming rather what is pleasing, however depraved, than
what is true: whose words are softer than oil, and the same
are darts, who say, peace, peace, and there shall be no peace
to them, who persevere in their sins, as says the prophet in
another place also, "It is not for the wicked to rejoice, saith
our Lord."</p>

<p>&sect; 41. Azarias, also, the son of Obed, spoke unto Asa,
who returned from the slaughter of the army of ten hundred
thousand Ethiopians, saying, "Our Lord is with you
while you remain with him, and if you will seek him out,
he will be found by you, and if you will leave him, he
will leave you also." For if Jehosaphat for only assisting a
wicked king, was thus reproved by the prophet Jehu, the
son of Ananias, saying, "If thou givest aid to a sinner, or
lovest them whom our Lord doth hate, the wrath of God
doth therefore hang over thee," what shall become of them
who are fettered in the snares of their own offences? whose
sin we must of necessity hate, if not their souls, if we wish
to fight in the army of the Lord, according to the words of
the Psalmist, "Hate ye evil, who love our Lord." What
was said to Jehoram, the son of the above-named Jehosaphat,
that most horrible murderer (who being himself a
bastard, slew his noble brethren, that he might possess the
throne in their place), by the prophet Elias, who was the
chariot and charioteer of Israel? "Thus speaketh the
Lord God of thy father David. Because thou hast not
walked in the way of thy father Jehosaphat, and in the
ways of Asa the king of Judah, but hast walked in the
ways of the kings of Israel, and in adultery according to the
behaviour of the house of Ahab, and hast moreover killed
thy brethren, the sons of Jehosaphat, men far better than
thyself, behold, our Lord shall strike thee and thy children
with a mighty plague." And a little afterwards, "And thou
shalt be very sick of a disease of thy belly, until thy entrails<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
shall, together with the malady itself, from day to day, come
forth out of thee." And listen also what the prophet Zachariah,
the son of Jehoiades, menaced to Joash, the king of
Israel, when he abandoned our Lord even as ye now do, and
the prophet spoke in this manner to the people: "Thus saith
our Lord, Why do ye transgress the commandments of our
Lord and do not prosper? Because ye have left our Lord,
he will also leave you."</p>

<p>&sect; 42. What shall I mention of Isaiah, the first and chief
of the prophets, who beginneth his prophecy, or rather
vision, in this way: "Hear, O ye heavens, and O thou earth
conceive in thine ears, because our Lord hath spoken, I have
nourished children, and exalted them, but they themselves
have despised me. The ox hath known his owner, and the
ass his master's crib, but Israel hath not known me, and my
people hath not understood." And a little further with
threatenings answerable to so great a folly, he saith, "The
daughter of Sion shall be utterly left as a tabernacle in the
vineyard, and as a hovel in the cucumber garden, and a city
that is sacked." And especially, convening and accusing the
princes, he saith, "Hear the word of our Lord, O ye princes
of Sodom, perceive ye the law of our Lord, O ye people of
Gomorrah." Wherein it is to be noted, that unjust kings
are termed the princes of Sodom, for our Lord, forbidding
sacrifices and gifts to be offered to him by such persons, and
seeing that we greedily receive those offerings which in all
nations are displeasing unto God, and to our own destruction
suffer them not to be bestowed on the poor and needy, speak
thus to them who, laden with riches, are likewise given to
offend on this head: "Offer no more your sacrifice in vain,
your incense is abomination unto me." And again he
denounceth them thus: "And when ye shall stretch out
your hands, I will turn away mine eyes from you, and when
ye shall multiply your prayers, I will not hear." And he
declareth wherefore he does this, saying, "Your hands are
full of blood." And likewise showing how he may be
appeased, he says, "Be ye washed, be ye clean, take away
the evil of your thoughts from mine eyes: cease to do evil,
learn to do well: seek for judgment, succour the oppressed,
do justice to the pupil or orphan." And then assuming as it
were the part of a reconciling mediator, he adds, "Though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
your sins shall be as scarlet, they shall be made white as
snow: though they shall be as red as the little worm,<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> they
shall be as white as wool. If ye shall be willing to hear me,
ye shall feed on the good things of the land; but if ye will
not, but provoke me unto wrath, the sword shall devour you."</p>

<p>&sect; 43. Receive ye the true and public avoucher, witnessing,
without any falsehood or flattery, the reward of your good
and evil, not like the soothing humble lips of your parasites,
which whisper poisons into your ears. And also directing
his sentence against ravenous judges, he saith thus: "Thy
princes are unfaithful, companions of thieves, all love gifts,
hunt after rewards: they do no justice to the orphan, the
widow's cause entereth not unto them. For thus saith our
Lord God of hosts, the strong one of Israel, Alas, I will
take consolation upon my foes, and be revenged upon mine
enemies; and the heinous sinners shall be broken to powder,
and offenders together with them, and all who have left our
Lord, shall be consumed." And afterwards, "The eyes of
the lofty man shall be brought low, and the height of men
hath bowed down." And again, "Woe be to the wicked,
evil befall him, for he shall be rewarded according to his
handy-work." And a little after, "Woe be unto you who
arise early to follow drunkenness, and to drink even to the
very evening, that ye may fume with wine. The harp, and
the lyre, and the tabor, and the pipe, and wine are in your
banquets, and the work of our Lord ye respect not, neither
yet consider ye the works of his hands. Therefore is my
people led captive away, because they have not had knowledge,
and their nobles have perished with famine, and their
multitude hath withered away with thirst. Therefore hath
hell enlarged and dilated his spirit, and without measure
opened his mouth, and his strong ones, and his people, and
his lofty and glorious ones, shall descend down unto him."
And afterwards, "Woe be unto you who are mighty for the
drinking of wine, and strong men for the procuring of
drunkenness, who justify the wicked for rewards, and
deprive the just man of his justice. For this cause even as
the tongue of the fire devoureth the stubble, and as the heat
of the flame burneth up, so shall their root be as the ashes,
and their branch shall rise up as the dust. For they have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
cast away the law of our Lord of hosts, and despised the
speech of the holy one of Israel. In all these the fury of
our Lord is not turned away, but as yet his hand is stretched
out."</p>

<p>&sect; 44. And further on, speaking of the day of judgment
and the unspeakable fears of sinners, he says, "Howl ye,
because the day of our Lord is near at hand (if so near at
that time, what shall it now be thought to be?) for destruction
shall proceed from God. For this shall all hands be
dissolved, and every man's heart shall wither away, and be
bruised; tortures and dolours shall hold them, as a woman in
labour so shall they be grieved, every man shall at his
neighbour stand astonished, burned faces shall be their
countenances. Behold, the day of our Lord shall come,
fierce and full of indignation, and of wrath, and fury, to
turn the earth into a desert, and break her sinners in small
pieces from off her; because the stars of heaven and the
brightness of them, shall not unfold their light, the sun in
his rising shall be covered over with darkness, and the moon
shall not shine in her season; and I will visit upon the evils
of the world, and against the wicked, their own iniquity, and
I will make the pride of the unfaithful to cease, and the
arrogancy of the strong, I will bring low." And again,
"Behold our Lord will disperse the earth, and he will strip
her naked, and afflict her face, and scatter her inhabitants;
and as the people, so shall be the priest; and as the slave, so
shall be his lord; as the handmaid, so shall be her lady; as
the purchaser, so shall be the seller; as the usurer, so shall
be he that borroweth; as he who demandeth, so shall he be
that oweth. With dispersing shall the earth be scattered,
and with sacking shall she be spoiled. For our Lord hath
spoken this word. The earth hath bewailed, and hath flitted
away; the world hath run to nothing, she is weakened by
her inhabitants, because they have transgressed laws,
changed right, brought to ruin the eternal truce. For this
shall malediction devour the earth."</p>

<p>&sect; 45. And afterwards, "They shall lament all of them
who now in heart rejoice, the delight of the timbrels hath
ceased, the sound of the gladsome shall be silent, the
sweetness of the harp shall be hushed, they shall not with
singing drink their wine, bitter shall be the potion to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
drinkers thereof. The city of vanity is wasted, every house
is shut up, no man entering in; an outcry shall be in the
streets over the wine, all gladness is forsaken, the joy of the
land is transferred, solitariness is left in the town, and
calamity shall oppress the gates, because these things shall
be in the midst of the land, and in the midst of the people."
And a little further, "Swerving from the truth, they have
wandered out of the right way, with the straggling of
transgressors have they gone astray. Fear and intrapping
falls, and a snare upon thee who art the inhabitant of the
earth. And it shall come to pass: whoso shall flee from the
voice of the fear, shall tumble down into the intrapping pit;
and whoso shall deliver himself out of the downfall, shall be
caught in the entangling snare: because the flood-gates from
aloft shall be opened, and the foundations of the earth shall
be shaken. With bruising shall the earth be broken, with
commotion shall she be moved, with tossing shall she be
shaken like a drunken man, and she shall be taken away as
if she were a pavilion of one night's pitching, and her
iniquities shall hang heavy upon her, and she shall fall
down, and shall not attempt to rise again. And it shall be,
that our Lord in the same day shall look on the warfare of
heaven on high, and on the kings of the earth, who are
upon the earth, and they shall be gathered together in the
bundle of one burden into the lake, and shall there be shut
up in prison, and after many days shall they be visited.
And the moon shall blush, and the sun be confounded,
when our Lord of hosts shall reign in Mount Sion and in
Jerusalem, and be glorified in the sight of his seniors."</p>

<p>&sect; 46. And after a while, giving a reason why he threateneth
in that sort, he says thus: "Behold the hand of our
Lord is not shortened that he cannot save, neither is his ear
made heavy that he may not hear. But your iniquities have
divided between you and your God, and your offences have
hid his face from you, that he might not hear. For your
hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity:
your lips have spoken lying, and your tongue uttereth
iniquity. There is none who calleth on justice, neither is
there he who judgeth truly, but they trust in nothing, and
speak vanities, and have conceived grief, and brought forth
iniquity." And a little after, "Their works are unprofitable,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
and the work of iniquity is in their hands; their feet run
into evil, and make haste that they may shed the innocent
blood; their thoughts are unprofitable thoughts, spoil and
confusion are in their ways, and the way of peace they have
not known, and in their steps there is no judgment, their
paths are made crooked unto them, every one who treadeth
in them is ignorant of peace; in this respect in judgment
removed far off from you, and justice taketh no hold on you."
And after a few words, "And judgment hath been turned
back, and justice hath stood afar off, because truth hath
fallen down in the streets, and equity could not enter in; and
truth is turned into oblivion, and whoso hath departed from
evil, hath lain open to spoil. And our Lord hath seen,
and it was not pleasing in his eyes, because there is not
judgment."</p>

<p>&sect; 47. And thus far may it suffice among many, to have
recited a few sentences out of the prophet Isaiah.</p>

<p>But now with diligent ears hearken unto him, who was
foreknown before he was formed in the belly, sanctified
before he came out of the womb, and appointed a prophet in
all nations: I mean Jeremiah, and hear what he hath pronounced
of foolish people and cruel kings, beginning his prophecy
in his mild and gentle manner.</p>

<p>"And the word of God was spoken unto me, saying, Go
and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, and thou shalt pronounce,
Hear the word of our Lord, thou house of Jacob, and all ye
kindred of the house of Israel: Thus saith our Lord; What
iniquity have your fathers found in me, who have been far
removed from me, and walked after vanity, and are become
vain, and have not said, Where is he who made us go up out
of the land of Egypt?" And after a few words, "From the
beginning of thine age thou hast broken my yoke, violated
my bands, and said, I will not serve, I have planted thee my
chosen vine, all true seed. How art thou therefore converted
into naughtiness? O strange vine! If thou shalt wash thee
with nitre, and multiply unto thee the herb borith, thou art
spotted in my sight with thine iniquity, saith our Lord."
And afterwards, "Why will ye contend with me in judgment?
Ye have all forsaken me, saith our Lord, in vain
have I corrected your children, they have not received discipline.
Hear ye the word of our Lord. Am I made a soli<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>tariness
unto Israel, or a late bearing land! why therefore
hath my people said, we have departed, we will come no
more unto thee? Doth the virgin forget her ornament, or
the spouse her gorget? my people truly hath forgotten me
for innumerable days. Because my people are foolish, they
have not known me, they are unwise and mad children.
They are wise to do evil, but to do well they have been
ignorant."</p>

<p>&sect; 48. Then the prophet speaketh in his own person saying,
"O Lord thine eyes do respect faith, thou hast stricken them,
and they have not sorrowed, thou hast broken them and they
have refused to receive discipline, they have made their
faces harder than the rock, and will not return." And also
our Lord: "Declare ye this same to the house of Jacob,
and make it to be heard in Judah, saying, Hear, ye foolish
people who have no heart, who having eyes see not, and ears
hear not. Will ye not therefore dread me, saith our Lord,
and will ye not conceive grief from my countenance, who
have placed the sand as the bound of the sea, an eternal
commandment which she shall not break, and her waves
shall be moved, and they cannot, and her surge shall swell,
and yet not pass the same? But to this people is framed an
incredulous and an exasperating heart, they have retired
and gone their ways, and not in their heart said, Let us fear
our Lord God." And again, "Because there are found
among my people wicked ones, framing wiles to entangle as
if they were fowlers, setting snares and gins to catch men:
as a net that is full of birds, so are their houses filled with
deceits. Therefore are they magnified and enriched, they
are become gross and fat, and have neglected my speeches
most vilely, the orphans' cause they have not decided, and
the justice of the poor they have not adjudged. What!
shall I not visit these men, saith our Lord? or shall not my
soul be revenged upon such a nation?"</p>

<p>&sect; 49. But God forbid that ever should happen unto you,
that which followeth, "Thou shalt speak all these words
unto them, and they shall not hear thee; and thou shalt call
them, and they shall not answer thee; and thou shalt say unto
them, This is the nation that hath not heard the voice of
their Lord God, nor yet received discipline, faith hath
perished, and been taken away from out of their mouth."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
And after some few speeches, "Whoso falleth doth he not
arise again, and whoso is turned away, shall he not return
again? why therefore is this people in Jerusalem, with a
contentious aversion alienated? they have apprehended
lying, and they will not come back again. I have been
attentive, and hearkened diligently, no man speaketh what
is good. There is none who repenteth of his sin, saying,
What have I done? All are turned unto their own course,
like a horse passing with violence to battle. The kite in
the sky hath known her time, the turtle, and swallow, and
stork have kept the season of their coming, but my people
hath not known the judgment of God." And the prophet,
being smitten with fear at so wonderful a blindness, and unspeakable
drunkenness of the sacrilegious, and lamenting
them who did not lament themselves (even according to the
present behaviour of these our unfortunate tyrants), beseecheth
of our Lord, that an augmentation of tears might
be granted him, speaking in this manner, "I am contrite
upon the contrition of the daughter of my people, astonishment
hath possessed me: is there no balm in Gilead, or is
there no physician there? Why therefore is not the wound
of the daughter of my people healed? Who shall give water
unto my head, and to mine eyes a fountain of tears, and I
will day and night bewail the slaughtered of my people?
who will grant me in the wilderness the inn of passengers?
and I will utterly leave my people, and depart from them;
because they are all of them adulterers, a root of offenders,
and they have bent their tongue as the bow of lying, and
not of truth, they are comforted in the earth, because they
have passed from evil to evil, and not known me, saith our
Lord." And again: "And our Lord hath said, Because
they have forsaken my law, which I have given them, and
not heard my voice, nor walked thereafter, and have wandered
away after the wickedness of their own heart, in that
respect our Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, saith these
words, Behold I will feed this people with wormwood, and
give them to drink the water of gall." And a little after
(speaking in the person of God), "See therefore thou do not
pray for this people, nor assume thou for them praise and
prayer, because I will not hear in the time of their outcry
unto me, and of their affliction."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span></p>

<p>&sect; 50. What then shall now our miserable governors do,
these few who found out the narrow way and left the large,
were by God forbidden to pour out their prayers for such as
persevered in their evils, and so highly provoked his wrath,
against whom on the contrary side when they returned with
all their hearts unto God (his divine Majesty being unwilling
that the soul of man should perish, but calling back the castaway
that he should not utterly be destroyed) the same prophets
could not procure the heavenly revenge, because Jonas,
when he desired the like most earnestly against the Ninevites,
could not obtain it. But in the meanwhile omitting
our own words, let us rather hear what the prophetic trumpet
soundeth in our ears speaking thus: "If thou shalt say in
thy heart, Why have these evils befallen? For the multitude
of thine iniquities. If the Ethiopian can change his skin, or
the leopard his sundry spots, ye may also do well when ye
have learned evil," ever supposing that ye will not. And
afterwards: "These words doth our Lord say to this people,
who have loved to move their feet, and have not rested, and
not pleased our Lord, Now shall he remember their iniquities,
and visit their offences; and our Lord said unto me,
Pray thou not for this people to work their good, when they
fast, I will not hear their prayers; and if they offer burnt
sacrifices and oblations, I will not receive them." And again,
"And our Lord said unto me, If Moses and Samuel shall
stand before me, my soul is not bent to this people, cast them
out away from my face, and let them depart." And after a
few words: "Who shall have pity on thee Jerusalem, or
who shall be sorrowful for thee, or who shall pray for thy
peace? Thou hast left me (saith our Lord) and gone away
backward, and I will stretch forth my hand over thee, and
kill thee." And somewhat after: "Thus saith our Lord,
Behold I imagine a thought against you, let every man return
from his evil course, and make straight your ways and
endeavours, who said, we despair, we will go after our own
thoughts, and every one of us will do the naughtiness of his
evil heart. Thus therefore saith our Lord, Ask the Gentiles,
who hath heard such horrible matters, which the virgin
Israel hath too often committed? Shall there fail from the
rock of the field, the snow of Libanus? or can the waters
be drawn dry that gush out cold and flowing? because my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
people hath forgotten me." And somewhat also after this
propounding unto them an election, he speaking saith,
"Thus saith our Lord, Do ye judgment and justice, and
deliver him who by power is oppressed out of the hand of
the malicious accuser; and for the stranger, and orphan, and
widow, do not provoke their sorrow, neither yet work ye unjustly
the grief of others, nor shed ye forth the innocent
blood. For if indeed ye shall accomplish this word, there
shall enter in through the gates of this house, kings of the
lineage of David, sitting upon his throne. But if ye will
not hearken unto these words, by myself I have sworn (saith
our Lord) that this house shall be turned into a desert."
And again (for he spoke of a wicked king), "As I live (saith
our Lord) if so be that Jechonias shall be a ring on my
right hand, I will pluck him away, and give him over into
the hands of them who seek his life."</p>

<p>&sect; 51. Moreover, holy Abraham crieth out, saying, "Woe
be unto them who build a city in blood, and prepare a town
in iniquities, saying, Are not these things from our almighty
Lord? and many people have failed in fire, and many nations
have been diminished." And thus complaining, he begins
his prophecy: "How long, O Lord, shall I call, and thou wilt
not hear? Shall I cry out unto thee, to what end hast thou
given me labours and griefs, to behold misery and impiety?"
And on the other side, "And judgment was sat upon, and
the judge hath taken in regard hereof, the law is rent in
pieces, and judgment is not brought fully to his conclusion,
because the wicked through power treadeth the just under
foot. In this respect hath passed forth perverse judgment."</p>

<p>&sect; 52. And mark ye also what blessed Hosea the prophet
says of princes: "For that they have transgressed my covenant,
and ordained against my law, and exclaimed, we have
known thee, because thou art against Israel. They have
persecuted good, as if it were evil. They have reigned for
themselves and not by me; they have held a principality,
neither yet have they acknowledged me."</p>

<p>&sect; 53. And hear ye likewise the holy prophet Amos, in
this sort threatening: "In three heinous offences of the sons
of Judah, and in four I will not convert them, for that they
have cast away the law of our Lord, and not kept his com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>mandments,
but their vanities have seduced them. And I
will send fire upon Judah, and it shall eat the foundations of
Jerusalem. Thus saith our Lord; In three grievous sins of
Israel, and in four I will not convert them, for that they have
sold the just for money, and the poor man for shoes, which
they tread upon the dust of the earth, and with buffets they
did beat the heads of the poor, and have eschewed the way
of the humble." And after a few words, "Seek our Lord
and ye shall live, that the house of Joseph may not shine as
fire, and the flame devour it, and he shall not be, that can
extinguish it. The house of Israel hath hated him who rebuketh
in the gates, and abhorred the upright word." Which
Amos, being forbidden to prophesy in Israel, without any
fawning flattery, saith in answer, "I was not a prophet, nor
yet the son of a prophet, but a goatherd; I was plucking
sycamores and our Lord took me from my herd, and our
Lord said unto me, Go thy way and prophesy against my
people of Israel: and now hear thou the word of our Lord
(for he directed his speech unto the king), thou sayest, do
not prophesy against Israel, and thou shalt not assemble
troops against the house of Jacob. For which cause our
Lord saith thus, thy wife in the city shall play the harlot,
and thy sons and daughters shall die by the sword, and thy
ground be measured by the cord, and thou in a polluted land
shalt end thy life, but for Israel, she shall be led from his
own country a captive." And afterwards, "Hear therefore
these words, ye who do outrageously afflict the poor, and
practise your mighty power against the needy of the earth,
who say, when shall the month pass over that we may purchase,
and the sabbaths that we may open the treasuries."
And within a few words after, "Our Lord doth swear against
the pride of Jacob, if he shall in contempt forget your actions,
and if in these the earth shall not be disturbed, and
every inhabitant thereof fall to lamentation, and the final
end as a flood ascend, and I will turn your festival days into
wailing, and cast haircloth on the loins of every one, and on
the head of every man baldness, and make him as the mourning
of one over beloved, and those who are with him as the
day of his sorrow." And again, "In the sword shall die all
the sinners of my people, who say, evils shall not approach,
nor yet shall light upon us."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span></p>

<p>&sect; 54. And listen ye, likewise, what holy Michah the
prophet hath spoken, saying, "Hearken, ye tribes. And
what shall adorn the city? Shall not fire? and the house
of the wicked hoarding up unjust treasures, and with
injury unrighteousness? If the wrongful dealer shall be
justified in the balance, and deceitful weights in the scales,
by which they have heaped up their riches in ungodliness."</p>

<p>&sect; 55. And hear also what threats the famous prophet
Zephaniah thundereth out: saith he, "The great day of our
Lord is near; it is at hand, and very swiftly approacheth.
The voice of the day of our Lord is appointed to be bitter
and mighty, that day, a day of wrath, a day of tribulation
and necessity, a day of clouds and mist, a day of the trumpet
and outcry, a day of misery and extermination, a day of
darkness and dimness upon the strong cities and high corners.
And I will bring men to tribulation, and they shall go as if
they were blind, because they have offended our Lord, and I
will pour out their blood as dust, and their flesh as the dung
of oxen, and their silver and gold shall not be able to deliver
them in the day of the wrath of our Lord. And in the fire
of his zeal shall the whole earth be consumed, when the
Lord shall accomplish his absolute end, and bring solitariness
upon all the inhabitants of the earth. Come together and
be joined in one, thou nation without discipline, before ye be
made as the fading flower, before the wrath of our Lord falleth
upon ye."</p>

<p>&sect; 56. And give ear also unto that which the prophet
Haggai speaketh: "Thus saith our Lord, I will once move
the heaven, and earth, and sea, and dry land, and I will
drive away the thrones of kings, and root out the power of
the kings of the Gentiles, and I will chase away the chariots
of those who mount upon them."</p>

<p>&sect; 57. Now also behold what Zacharias the son of Addo,
that chosen prophet, said, beginning his prophecy in this
manner: "Return to me, and I will return unto you, saith
our Lord, and be not like your fathers, to whom the former
prophets have imputed, saying, Thus saith our almighty
Lord, Turn away from your ways, and they have not marked
whereby they might obediently hear me." And afterwards,
"And the angel asked me, what dost thou see? And I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
said, I see a flying scythe, which containeth in length
twenty cubits. The malediction which hath proceeded upon
the face of the whole earth; because every one of her
thieves shall be punished even to the death, and I will throw
him away, saith our almighty Lord, and he shall enter into
the house of fury, and into the house of swearing falsehood
in my name."</p>

<p>&sect; 58. Holy Malachy the prophet also saith, "Behold,
the day of our Lord shall come, inflamed as a furnace,
and all proud men, and all workers of iniquity shall be
as stubble, and the approaching day of the Lord of hosts
shall set them on fire, which shall not leave a root nor a bud
of them."</p>

<p>&sect; 59. And hearken ye also what holy Job debateth of the
beginning and end of the ungodly, saying, "For what purpose
do the wicked live, and have grown old dishonestly, and
their issue hath been according to their own desire, and
their sons before their faces, and their houses are fruitful,
and no fear nor yet the scourge of our Lord is upon them.
Their cow hath not been abortive, their great with young
hath brought forth her young ones and not missed, but remaineth
as an eternal breed; and their children rejoice, and
taking the psaltery and harp, have finished their days in felicity
and fallen peaceably asleep down into hell." Doth God,
therefore, not behold the works of the wicked? Not so,
truly, "But the candle of the ungodly shall be extinguished,
and destruction shall fall upon them, and pains as of one in
childbirth, shall withhold them from wrath; and they shall
be as chaff before the wind, and as the dust which the whirlwind
hath carried away. Let all goodness fail his children;
let his eyes behold his own slaughter, nor yet by our Lord
let him be redeemed." And a little after, he saith of the
same men, "Who have ravenously taken the flock with the
shepherd, and driven away the beast of the orphans, and engaged
the ox of the widow, and deceiving, have declined
from the way of necessity. They have reaped other men's
fields before the time; the poor have laboured in the vineyards
of the mighty without hire and meat, they have made
many to sleep naked without garments; of the covering of
their life they have bereaved them." And somewhat afterwards,
when he had thoroughly understood their works, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
delivered them over to darkness. "Let, therefore, his portion
be accursed from the earth; let his plantings bring forth
witherings; let him for this be rewarded according to his
dealings; let every wicked man like the unsound wood be
broken in pieces. For arising in his wrath hath he overthrown
the impotent. Wherefore truly shall he have no
trust of his life; when he shall begin to grow diseased, let
him not hope for health, but fall into languishing. For his
pride hath been the hurt of many, and he is become decayed
and rotten, as the mallows in the scorching heat, or as the
ear of corn when it falleth off from its stubble." And afterwards,
"If his children shall be many, they shall be turned
to the slaughter, and if he gather together silver as if it were
earth, and likewise purify his gold as if it were dirt, all
these same shall the just obtain."</p>

<p>&sect; 60. Hear ye moreover what blessed Esdras, that cyclop&aelig;dia
of the divine law, threateneth in his discourse. "Thus
saith our Lord God: My right hand shall not be sparing
upon sinners, neither shall the sword cease over them who
spill the innocent blood on the earth. Fire shall proceed
from out of my wrath, and devour the foundations of the
earth, and sinners as if they were inflamed straw. Woe be
unto them who offend, and observe not my commandments,
saith our Lord, I will not forbear them. Depart from me ye
apostatizing children, and do not pollute my sanctuary. God
doth know who offend against him, and he will therefore
deliver them over to death and to slaughter. For now have
many evils passed over the round compass of the earth. A
sword of fire is sent out against you, and who is he that
shall restrain it? shall any man repulse a lion that hungereth
in the wood? or shall any one quench out the fire when the
straw is burning? our Lord God will send out evils, and who
is he that shall repress them? and fire will pass forth from
out of his wrath, and who shall extinguish it? it shall
brandishing shine, and who will not fear it? it shall thunder,
and who will not shake with dread? God will threaten all,
and who will not be terrified? before his face the earth
doth tremble, and the foundations of the sea shake from the
depths."</p>

<p>&sect; 61. And mark ye also what Ezechiel the renowned
prophet, and admirable beholder of the four evangelical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
creatures, speaketh of wicked offenders, unto whom pitifully
lamenting beforehand the scourge that hung over Israel, our
Lord doth say, "Too far hath the iniquity of the house of
Israel and Judah prevailed, because the earth is filled with
iniquity and uncleanness. Behold I am, mine eyes shall not
spare, nor will I take pity." And afterwards, "Because the
earth is replenished with people, and the city fraughted with
iniquity, I will also turn away the force of their power, and
their holy things shall be polluted, prayer shall approach and
sue for peace, and it shall not be obtained." And somewhat
after, "The word of our Lord, quoth he, was spoken unto me,
saying, Thou son of man, the land that shall so far sin against
me as to commit an offence, I will stretch forth my hand upon
her, and break in pieces her foundation of bread, and send
upon her famine, and take away mankind and cattle from her;
and if these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, be in the
midst of her, they shall not deliver her, but they in their
justice shall be saved, saith our Lord. If so be that also I
shall bring in evil beasts upon the land and punish her, she
likewise shall be turned to destruction, and there shall not be
one who shall have free passage from the face of the beasts,
and although these three men are in the midst of her, as I
live, saith our Lord, their sons and daughters shall not be
preserved, but they alone shall be saved, and as for the land
it shall fall to confusion." And again, "The son shall not
receive the unrighteousness of the father, neither the father
the son's unrighteousness. The justice of the just shall be
upon himself. And the unjust man, if he turneth him away
from all the iniquities which he hath done, and keepeth all
my commandments, and doth justice and abundance of mercy,
he shall live in life and shall not die. All his sins, whatsoever
he hath committed, shall have no further being; he shall live
the life in his own justice which he hath performed. Do I
with my will voluntarily wish the death of the unrighteous,
saith our Lord, rather than that he should return from his
evil way and live? But when the just shall turn himself
away from his justice, and do iniquity, according to all the
iniquities which the unrighteous hath committed, all the just
actions (which he hath done) shall remain no further in
memory. In his offence wherein he hath fallen, and in his
sins in which he hath transgressed, he shall die." And,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
within some words afterwards: "And all nations shall
understand, that the house of Israel are led captive away
for their offences, because they have forsaken me. And I
have turned my face from them, and yielded them over into
the hands of their enemies, and all have perished by the
sword; according unto their unclean sins, and after their
iniquities have I dealt with them, and turned my face away
from them."</p>

<p>&sect; 62. This which I have spoken may suffice concerning
the threats of the holy prophets: only I have thought it
necessary to intermingle in this little work of mine, not only
these menaces, but also a few words borrowed out of the
wisdom of Solomon, to declare unto kings matters of exhortation
or instruction, that they may not say I am willing to
load the shoulders of men with heavy and insupportable
burdens of words, but not so much as once with mine own
finger (that is, with speech of consolation) to move the same.
Let us therefore hear what the prophet hath spoken to rule
us. "Love justice," saith he, "ye that judge the earth." This
testimony alone (if it were with a full and perfect heart
observed) would abundantly suffice to reform the governors
of our country. For if they had loved justice, they would
also love God, who is in a sort the fountain and original of
all justice. "Serve our Lord in goodness, and seek him in
simplicity of heart." Alas! who shall live (as a certain one
before us hath said) when such things are done by our
countrymen, if perchance they may be any where accomplished?
"Because he is found of those who do not tempt
him, he appeareth truly to them who have faith in him."
For these men without respect do tempt God, whose commandments
with stubborn despite they contemn, neither yet
do they keep to him their faith, unto whose oracles be they
pleasing, or somewhat severe, they turn their backs and not
their faces. "For perverse thoughts do separate from God,"
and this in the tyrants of our time very plainly appeareth.
But why doth our meanness intermeddle in this so manifest
a determination? Let therefore him who alone is true (as
we have said) speak for us, I mean the Holy Ghost, of whom
it is now pronounced, "The Holy Ghost verily will avoid
the counterfeiting of discipline." And again, "Because the
Spirit of God hath filled the globe of the earth." And after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>wards
(showing with an evident judgment the end of the
evil and righteous) he saith, "How is the hope of the wicked
as the down that is blown away with the wind, and as the
smoke that with the blast is dispersed, and as the slender
froth that with a storm is scattered, and as the memory of a
guest who is a passenger of one day. But the just shall live
for ever, and with God remaineth their reward, and their
cogitation is with the Highest. Therefore shall they receive
the kingdom of glory, and the crown of beauty from the
hand of our Lord. Because with his right hand he will
protect them, and with his holy arm defend them." For
very far unlike in quality are the just and ungodly, as our
Lord verily hath spoken, saying, "Them who honour me
I will honour, and whoso despise me shall be of no
estimation."</p>

<p>&sect; 63. But let us pass over to the rest: "Hearken, (saith
he) all ye kings, and understand ye; learn, ye judges of the
bounds of the earth, listen with your ears who keep multitudes
in awe, and please yourselves in the troops of nations.
Because power is given unto you from God, and puissance
from the highest, who will examine your actions, and sift
your thoughts. For that when ye were ministers of his
kingdom, ye have not judged uprightly, nor kept the law of
justice, nor yet walked according to his will. It shall
dreadfully and suddenly appear unto you, that a most severe
judgment shall be given on them who govern. For to the
meaner is mercy granted, but the mighty shall mightily
sustain torments. For he shall have no respect of persons,
who is the ruler of all, nor yet shall he reverence the
greatness of any one, because he himself hath made both
small and great, and care alike he hath of all; but for the
stronger is at hand a stronger affliction. Unto you therefore,
O kings, are these my speeches, that you may learn wisdom,
and not fall away from her. For whoso observeth what
things are just shall be justified, and whoso learneth what
things are holy, shall be sanctified."</p>

<p>&sect; 64. Hitherto have we discoursed no less by the oracles
of the prophets, than by her own speeches with the kings of
our country, being willing they should know what the
prophet hath spoken, saying, "As from the face of a serpent,
so fly thou from sins: if thou shalt approach unto them they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
will catch thee, their teeth are the teeth of a lion, such as
kill the souls of men." And again, "How mighty is the
mercy of our Lord, and his forgiveness to such as turn unto
him." And if we have not in us such apostolical zeal, that
we may say, "I did verily desire to be anathematized by
Christ for my brethren," notwithstanding that we may from
the bottom of our hearts speak that prophetic saying,
"Alas! that the soul perisheth." And again, "Let us
search out our ways, and seek and return unto our Lord: let
us lift our hearts together with our hands to God in heaven."
And also that of the apostle, "We covet that every one of
you should be in the bowels of Christ."</p>

<p>&sect; 65. And how willingly, as one tossed on the waves of
the sea, and now arrived in a desired haven, would I in this
place make an end (shame forbidding me further to proceed),
did I not behold such great masses of evil deeds done
against God by bishops or other priests, or clerks, yea some
of our own order, whom as witnesses myself must of
necessity first of all stone (according unto the law) with the
hard blows of words, lest I should be otherwise reproved
for partiality towards persons, and then afterwards the
people (if as yet they keep their decrees) must pursue with
their whole powers the same execution upon them, not to
their corporal death, but to the death of their vices and their
eternal life with God. Yet, as I before said, I crave pardon
of them, whose lives I not only praise, but also prefer before
all earthly treasure, and of the which, if it may be, yet
before my death I desire and thirst to be a partaker: and so
having both my sides defended with the double shields of
saints, and by those means invincibly strengthened to sustain
all that arise against me, arming moreover my head in place
of a helmet with the help of our Lord, and being most
assuredly protected with the sundry aids of the prophets, I
will boldly proceed notwithstanding the stones of worldly
rioters fly never so fast about me.</p>

<p>&sect; 66. Britain hath priests, but they are unwise; very
many that minister, but many of them impudent; clerks she
hath, but certain of them are deceitful raveners; pastors (as
they are called) but rather wolves prepared for the slaughter
of souls (for they provide not for the good of the common
people, but covet rather the gluttony of their own bellies),<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
possessing the houses of the church, but obtaining them for
filthy lucre's sake; instructing the laity, but showing withal
most depraved examples, vices, and evil manners; seldom
sacrificing, and seldom with clean hearts, standing at the
altars; not correcting the commonality for their offences,
while they commit the same sins themselves; despising the
commandments of Christ, and being careful with their
whole hearts to fulfil their own lustful desires, some of them
usurping with unclean feet the seat of the apostle Peter;
but for the demerit of their covetousness falling down into
the pestilent chair of the traitor Judas; detracting often,
and seldom speaking truly; hating verity as an open enemy,
and favouring falsehoods, as their most beloved brethren;
looking on the just, the poor, and the impotent, with stern
countenances, as if they were detested serpents, and reverencing
the sinful rich men without any respect of shame,
as if they were heavenly angels, preaching with their
outward lips that alms are to be disbursed upon the needy,
but of themselves not bestowing one halfpenny; concealing
the horrible sins of the people, and amplifying injuries
offered unto themselves, as if they were done against our
Saviour Christ; expelling out of their houses their religious
mother, perhaps, or sisters, and familiarly and indecently
entertaining strange women, as if it were for some more
secret office, or rather, to speak truly, though fondly (and
yet not fondly to me, but to such as commit these matters),
debasing themselves unto such bad creatures; and after all
these seeking rather ambitiously for ecclesiastical dignities,
than for the kingdom of heaven; and defending after a
tyrannical fashion their achieved preferments, nor even
labouring with lawful manners, to adorn the same; negligent
and dull to listen to the precepts of the holy saints (if ever
they did so much as once hear that which full often they
ought to hear), but diligent and attentive to the plays and
foolish fables of secular men, as if they were the very ways
to life, which indeed are but the passages to death; being
hoarse, after the fashion of bulls, with the abundance of
fatness, and miserably prompt to all unlawful actions;
bearing their countenances arrogantly aloft, and having
nevertheless their inward senses, with tormenting and
gnawing consciences; depressed down to the bottom or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
rather to the bottomless pit; glad at the gaining of one
penny, and at the loss of the like value sad; slothful and
dumb in the apostolical decrees (be it for ignorance or rather
the burden of their offences), and stopping also the mouths
of the learned, but singularly experienced in the deceitful
shifts of worldly affairs; and many of this sort and wicked
conversation, violently intruding themselves into the preferments
of the church; yea, rather buying the same at a
high rate, than being any way drawn thereunto, and moreover
as unworthy wretches, wallowing, after the fashion of
swine, in their old and unhappy puddle of intolerable
wickedness, after they have attained unto the seat of the
priesthood or episcopal dignity (who neither have been
installed, or resident on the same), for usurping only the
name of priesthood, they have not received the orders or
apostolical pre-eminence; but how can they who are not as
yet fully instructed in faith, nor have done penance for their
sins, be any way supposed meet and convenient to ascend
unto any ecclesiastical degree (that I may not speak of the
highest) which none but holy and perfect men, and followers
of the apostles, and, to use the words of the teacher of the
Gentiles, persons free from reprehension, can lawfully and
without the foul offence of sacrilege undertake.</p>

<p>&sect; 67. For what is so wicked and so sinful as after the example
of Simon Magus (even if with other faults he had not
been defiled before), for any man with earthly price to purchase
the office of a bishop or priest, which with holiness
and righteous life alone ought lawfully to be obtained; but
herein they do more wilfully and desperately err, in that
they buy their deceitful and unprofitable ecclesiastical degrees,
not of the apostles or their successors, but of tyrannical
princes, and their father the devil; yea, rather they raise
this as a certain roof and covering of all offences, over the
frame of their former serious life, that being protected under
the shadow thereof, no man should lightly hereafter lay to
their charge their old or new wickedness; and hereupon they
build their desires of covetousness and gluttony, for that
being now the rulers of many they may more freely make
havoc at their pleasure. For if truly any such offer of
purchasing ecclesiastical promotions were made by these impudent
sinners (I will not say with St. Peter), but to any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
holy priest, or godly king, they would no doubt receive the
same answer which their father Simon Magus had from the
mouth of the apostle Peter, saying: "Thy money be with
thee unto thy perdition." But, alas! perhaps they who
order and advance these ambitious aspirers, yea, they who
rather throw them under foot, and for a blessing give them
a cursing, whilst of sinners they make them not penitents
(which were more consonant to reason), but sacrilegious and
desperate offenders, and in a sort install Judas, that traitor
to his Master, in the chair of Peter, and Nicholas, the author
of that foul heresy, in the seat of St. Stephen the martyr, it
may be at first obtained their own priesthood by the same
means, and therefore do not greatly dislike in their children,
but rather respect the course, that they their fathers did
before follow. And also, if finding resistance, in obtaining
their dioceses at home, and some who severely renounce this
chaffering of church-livings, they cannot there attain to such
a precious pearl, then it doth not so much loath as delight
them (after they have carefully sent their messengers beforehand)
to cross the seas, and travel over most large countries,
that so, in the end, yea even with the sale of their whole substance,
they may win and compass such a pomp, and such an
incomparable glory, or to speak more truly, such a dirty and
base deceit and illusion. And afterwards with great show and
magnificent ostentation, or rather madness, returning back to
their own native soil, they grow from stoutness to stateliness,
and from being used to level their looks to the tops of the
mountains, they now lift up their drowsy eyes into the air,
even to the highest clouds, and as Novatus, that foul hog,
and persecutor of our Lord's precious jewel, did once at
Rome, so do these intrude themselves again into their own
country, as creatures of a new mould, or rather as instruments
of the devil, being even ready in this state and fashion
to stretch out violently their hands (not so worthy of the
holy altars as of the avenging flames of hell) upon Christ's
most holy sacrifices.</p>

<p>&sect; 68. What do you therefore, O unhappy people! expect
from such belly beasts? (as the apostle calleth them). Shall
your manners be amended by these, who not only do not
apply their minds to any goodness, but according to the upbraiding
of the prophet, labour also to deal wickedly? Shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
ye be illuminated with such eyes as are only with greediness
cast on those things that lead headlong to vices (that is to
say), to the gates of hell? Nay truly, if according to the
saying of our Saviour, ye flee not these most ravenous wolves
like those of Arabia, or avoid them as Lot, who ran most
speedily from the fiery shower of Sodom up to the mountains,
then, being blind and led by the blind, ye will both together
tumble down into the infernal ditch.</p>

<p>&sect; 69. But some man perchance will objecting say, that all
bishops or all priests (according to our former exception),
are not so wickedly given, because they are not defiled with
the infamy of schism, pride, or unclean life, which neither
we ourselves will deny, but albeit we know them to be chaste,
and virtuous, yet will we briefly answer.</p>

<p>What did it profit the high-priest Hely, that he alone did
not violate the commandments of our Lord, in taking flesh
with forks out of the pots, before the fat was offered unto
God, while he was punished with the same revenge of death
wherewith his sons were? What one, I beseech you, of them,
whose manners we have before sufficiently declared, hath
been martyred like Abel, from malicious jealousy of his more
acceptable sacrifice, which with the heavenly fire ascended
up into the skies, since they fear the reproach even of an
ordinary word? Which of them "hath hated the counsel of
the malicious, and not sat with the ungodly," so that of him
as a prophet, the same might be verified which was said of
Enoch, "Enoch walked with God and was not to be found"
in the vanity (forsooth) of the whole world, as then leaving
our Lord, and beginning to halt after idolatry? Which of
them, like Noah in the time of the deluge, hath not admitted
into the ark of salvation (which is the present church) any
adversary unto God, that it may be most apparent that none
but innocents or singular penitents, ought to remain in the
house of our Lord? Who is he that offering sacrifice like
Melchisedeck, hath only blessed the conquerors, and them
who with the number of three hundred (which was in the
sacrament of the Trinity) delivering the just man, have overthrown
the deadly armies of the five kings, together with
their vanquishing troops, and not coveted the goods of others?
Which of them hath like Abraham, at the commandment of
God freely offered his own son on the altar to be slain, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
he might accomplish a precept of Christ, agreeable to this
saying, Thy right eye, if it cause thee to offend, ought to be
pulled out; and another of the prophet, That he is accursed
who withholdeth his sword from shedding blood? Who is he
that like Joseph, hath rooted out of his heart the remembrance
of an offered injury? Who is he that like Moses,
speaking with our Lord in the mountain, and not there terrified
with the sounding trumpets, hath in a figurative sense
presented unto the incredulous people the two tables, and his
horned face which they could not endure to see, but trembled
to behold? Which of them, praying for the offences of
the people, has from the very bottom of his heart cried out,
like unto him, saying: "O Lord this people hath committed
a grievous sin, which if thou wilt forgive them, forgive it;
otherwise blot me guilty out of thy book?"</p>

<p>&sect; 70. Which of them, inflamed with the admirable zeal of
God, hath courageously risen to punish fornication, curing
without delay by the present medicine of penance, the affection
of filthy lust, lest the fire of the wrath of God should
otherwise consume the people, as Phineas the priest did,
that by these means justice for ever might be reputed unto
him? Which of them hath in moral understanding imitated
Joshua, the son of Nun, either for the utter rooting forth,
even to the slaughter of the last and least of all, the seven
nations out of the land of promise, or for the establishing of
spiritual Israel in their places? Which of them hath showed
unto the people of God their final bounds beyond Jordan
that it might be known what was suited to every tribe, in
such sort as the aforenamed Phineas and Jesus have wisely
divided the land? Who is he that to overthrow the innumerable
thousands of Gentiles, adversaries to the chosen people
of God, hath, as another Jephtha, for a votive and propitiatory
sacrifice, slain his own daughter (by which is to be understood
his own proper will), imitating also therein the
apostle, saying, "Not seeking what is profitable to me, but to
many, that they may be saved;" which daughter of his
met the conquerors with drums and dances, by which are
to be understood the lustful desires of the flesh? Which of
them, that he might disorder, put to flight, and overthrow
the camps of the proud Gentiles, by the number of three
hundred, (being, as we before said, the mystery of the blessed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
Trinity,) and with his men holding in their hands those noble
sounding trumpets, (which are prophetical and apostolical
senses, according as our Lord said to the prophet, "Exalt
thy voice as a trumpet;" and the psalmist of the apostles,
"Their sound hath passed throughout the whole earth,") and
bearing all those famous flagons shining in the night with
that most glittering fiery light, (which are to be interpreted
the bodies of saints joined to good works, and burning with
the flame of the Holy Ghost, yea having, as the apostle
writes, "This treasure in earthen vessels,") hath after hewing
down the idolatrous grave (by which is morally meant dark
and foul desire) marched on like Gideon, with an assured faith
in the evident sign of the fleece, which to the Jews was void
of the heavenly moisture, but to the Gentiles made wet with
the dew of the Holy Ghost?</p>

<p>&sect; 71. Who is he among them that (earnestly wishing to
die to this world, and live to Christ) hath, as another Sampson,
utterly cut off such innumerable luxurious banqueters
of the Gentile, while they praised their gods, (by which is
meant, while the senses of men extolled these earthly riches,
according to the apostle speaking thus: "And covetousness,
which is idolatry"), shaking with the power of both his arms
the two pillars (by which are to be understood the wicked
pleasures of the soul and body), by which the house of all
worldly wickedness is in a sort compacted and underpropped?
Which of them, like Samuel, with prayers and the burnt
sacrifice of a sucking lamb, hath driven away the fear of the
Philistines, raised unexpected thunderclaps, and showering
clouds, established without flattery a king, deposed him
when he displeased God, and anointed another his better in
his place and kingdom; and when he shall give to the people
his last farewell, shall appear like Samuel in this sort, saying,
"Behold, I am ready, speak ye before our Lord and his
anointed, whether I ever took away the ox or ass of any
man, if I have falsely accused any one, if I have oppressed
anybody, if I have received a bribe from the hands of any?"
Unto whom it was answered by the people, "Thou hast not
wrongfully charged us, nor oppressed us, nor taken anything
from the hands of any." Which of them, like the famous
prophet Elias, who consumed with heavenly fire the hundred
proud men, and preserved the fifty that humbled themselves;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
and afterwards denounced without flattery or dissimulation,
the impending death of the unjust king (that sought not the
counsel of God by his prophets, but of the idol Accaron),
hath utterly overthrown all the prophets of Baal (by which
are meant the worldly senses ever bent, as we have already
said, to envy and avarice), with the lightning sword (which
is the word of God)? And as the same Elias, moved with
the zeal of God, after taking away the showers of rain from
the land of the wicked, who were now shut up with famine
in a strong prison, as it were of penury, for three years and
six months, being himself ready to die for thirst in the
desert, hath, complaining, said, "They have murdered, O
Lord, thy prophets, and undermined thine altars, and I alone
am left, and they seek my life?"</p>

<p>&sect; 72. Which of them, like Elisha, hath punished his
dearly beloved disciple, if not with an everlasting leprosy,
yet at least by abandoning him, if burdened too much with
the weight of worldly covetousness for those very gifts
which his master before (although very earnestly entreated
thereto) had despised to receive? And which of these
among us hath like him revealed unto his servant, (who
despaired of life, and on a sudden trembled at the warlike
army of the enemies that besieged the city wherein he was),
through the fervency of his prayers poured out unto God,
those spiritual visions, so that he might behold a mountain
replenished with a heavenly assisting army, of warlike chariots
and horsemen, shining with fiery countenances, and that
he might also believe that he was stronger to save, than the
foe to hurt? And which of them, like the above-named
Elisha, with the touch of his body, being dead to the world,
but living unto God, shall raise up another, whose fate had
been different from his, namely, death to God, but life to his
vices, so that instantly revived, he may yield humble thanks
to Christ for his unexpected recovery from the hellish torments
of his mortal crimes? Which of them hath his lips
purified and made clean with the fiery coals earned by the
tongues of the cherubim, from off the altar, (that his sins
may be wiped away with the humility of confession), as it is
written of Esaias, by whose effectual prayers, together with
the aid of the godly king Ezechias, a hundred fourscore and
five thousand of the Assyrian army, through the stroke of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
one angel, without the least print of any appearing wound,
were overthrown and slain? Which of them, like blessed
Jeremiah, for accomplishing the commandments of God,&mdash;for
denouncing the threats thundered out from heaven, and for
preaching the truth even to such as would not hear the same,
hath suffered loathsome stinking prisons as momentary
deaths? And to be brief, what one of them (as the teacher
of the Gentiles said) hath endured like the holy prophets to
wander in mountains, in dens, and caves of the earth, to be
stoned, to be sawn in sunder, and assailed with all kinds of
death, for the name of our Lord?</p>

<p>&sect; 73. But why do we dwell in examples of the Old Testament
as if there were none in the New? Let, therefore,
those, who suppose they can, without any labour at all, under
the naked pretence of the name of priesthood, enter this
strait and narrow passage of Christian religion, hearken unto
me while I recite and gather into one a few of the chiefest
flowers out of the large and pleasant meadow of the saintly
soldiers of the New Testament. Which of you (who rather
sleep than lawfully sit in the chair of the priesthood), being
cast out of the council of the wicked, hath, after the stripes
of sundry rods, like the holy apostles, from the bottom of his
heart, given thanks to the blessed Trinity that he was found
worthy to suffer disgrace for Christ's true deity? What
one, for the undoubted testimony of God, having his brains
dashed out with the fuller's club, hath, like James the first,
a bishop of the New Testament, suffered corporal death?
Which of you, like James the brother of John, has by the
unjust prince been beheaded? Who, like the first deacon
and martyr of the gospel, (having but this only accusation,
that he saw God, whom the wicked could not behold), has
by ungodly hands been stoned to death? What one of you,
like the worthy keeper of the keys of the heavenly kingdom,
has been nailed to the cross with his feet upward, in reverence
for Christ, whom, no less in his death than in his life,
he endeavoured to honour, and hath so breathed his last?
Which of you, for the confession of the true word of Christ,
hath, like the vessel of election, and chosen teacher of the
Gentiles, after suffering imprisonment and shipwreck, after
the terrible scourges of whips, the continual dangers of seas,
of thieves, of Gentiles, of Jews, and of false apostles, after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
the labours of famine, fasting, and watching, after incessant
care over all the churches, after his trouble for such as
scandalized, after his infirmity for the weak, after his wonderful
travels over almost the whole world in preaching the
gospel of Christ, lost his head at last by the stroke of the
descending sword?</p>

<p>&sect; 74. Which of you, like the holy martyr Ignatius, bishop
of the city of Antioch, hath after his miraculous actions in
Christ, for testimony of him been torn by the jaws of lions,
as he was once at Rome? whose words, as he was led to his
passion, when you shall hear (if ever your countenances
were overcome with blushing), you will not only, in comparison
of him, esteem yourselves no priests, but not so much
even as the meanest Christians; for in the epistle which he
sent to the church of Rome, he writeth thus: "From Syria
even unto Rome, I fight with beasts, by land and sea, being
bound and chained unto ten leopards, I mean the soldiers
appointed for my custody, who for our benefit bestowed upon
them become more cruel; but I am the better instructed by
their wickedness, neither yet am I in this justified; oh!
when shall those beasts come the workers of my salvation,
which are for me prepared? when shall they be let loose at
me? when shall it be lawful for my carcass to enjoy them?
whom I do most earnestly wish to be eagerly enraged against
me, and truly I will incite them to devour me; moreover, I
will humbly pray, lest perchance they should dread to touch
my body (as in some others they have before done), yea also,
if they hesitate, I will offer violence, I will force myself
upon them. Pardon me, I beseech you, I know what is
commodious for me, even now I begin to be the disciple of
Christ; let all envy, whether of human affection or spiritual
wickedness cease, that I may endeavour to obtain Christ
Jesus; let fires, let crosses, let cruelty of beasts, let breaking
of bones, and rending of limbs, with all the pains of the
whole body, and all the torments devised by the art of the
devil, be together poured out on me alone, so that I may
merit to attain unto Christ Jesus." Why do you behold
these things with the sleepy eyes of your souls? why do you
hearken unto them with the deaf ears of your senses?
Shake off, I beseech you, the dark and black mist of
slothfulness from your hearts, that so you may see the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
glorious light of truth and humility. A Christian, and he
not mean, but a perfect one, and a priest not base, but one of
the highest, a martyr of no ordinary sort, but one of the
chiefest, saith: "Now I begin to be the disciple of Christ."
And you, like the same Lucifer, who was thrown down out
of heaven, are puffed up with words, and not with power,
and after a sort do chew under the tooth, and make pretence
in your actions, as the author of this your wickedness hath
thus expressed: "I will mount up into the heavens, and be
like unto the Highest." And again: "I have digged and
drunk water, and dried up with the steps of my feet all the
rivers of the banks." You would more rightly have
imitated him and hearkened unto his words, who is without
doubt the most true example of all goodness and humility,
saying by his prophet, "I am verily a worm and not a man,
the reproach of men, and the outcast of the people." Oh
unspeakable matter! that he called himself "the reproach of
men," when he washed away the reproaches of the whole
world. And again in the gospel; "I am not able to do any
thing of myself," when at the same time he was co-eternal
with the Father, coequal with the Holy Ghost, and consubstantial
with both, and created, not by the help of
another, but by his own almighty power, the heaven and
earth, with all their inestimable ornaments; and ye nevertheless
have arrogantly lifted up your voices, notwithstanding
the prophet saith, "Why do earth and ashes swell with
pride?"</p>

<p>&sect; 75. But let us return unto our subject. Which of you,
I say, like Polycarp, the famous bishop of the church of
Smyrna, that witness of Christ, hath courteously entertained
as guests at his table, those who violently drew him out to
be burned? and when for the charity which he did bear
unto Christ, he was brought to the stake, said, "He who
gave me grace to endure the torment of the fire, will
likewise grant me without fastening of nails to bear the
flames with patience." And now passing over in this my
discourse the mighty armies of saints, I will yet touch on
one only, for example's sake, Basil the bishop of C&aelig;saria,
who when he was thus by the unrighteous prince threatened
that, unless he would on the next day be as the rest, defiled
in the dirty dunghill of the Arian heresy, he should be put<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
to death, answered, as it is reported, "I will be to-morrow
the same as to-day, and for thee, I do not wish thee to
change thy determination." And again, "Would that I
had some worthy reward to bestow on him that would
discharge Basil from the bands of this breathing bellows."
Which one of you doth endeavour to daunt the menaces of
tyrants, by inviolably keeping the rule of the apostolical
speech, which in all times and ages hath been observed by
all holy priests, to suppress the suggestion of men when they
sought to draw them into wickedness, saying in this manner;
"It behoveth us to obey God rather than men."</p>

<p>&sect; 76. Wherefore after our accustomed manner, taking
refuge in the mercy of our Lord, and in the sentences of his
holy prophets, that they on our behalf may now level the
darts of their oracles at imperfect pastors (as before at
tyrants), so that thereby they may receive compunction and
be amended, let us see what manner of threats our Lord doth
by his prophets utter against slothful and dishonest priests,
and such as do not, both by examples and words, rightly
instruct the people. For even Eli, the priest in Shilo,
because he did not severely proceed, with a zeal worthy of
God, in punishing his sons, when they contemned our Lord,
but, as a man overswayed with a fatherly affection, too
mildly and remissly admonished them, was sentenced with
this judgment by the prophet speaking unto him: "Thus
saith our Lord; I have manifestly showed myself unto the
house of thy father, when they were the servants of Pharaoh
in Egypt, and have chosen the house of thy father out of all
the tribes of Israel, for a priesthood unto me." And a little
after, "Why hast thou looked upon mine incense, and upon
my sacrifice, with a dishonest eye? and hast honoured thy
children more than me, that thou mightest bless them from
the beginning in all sacrifices in my presence? And now so
saith our Lord: Because whoever honoureth me I will honour
him again; and whoso maketh no account of me shall be
brought to nothing. Behold the days shall come, and I will
destroy thy name, and the seed of thy father's house. And
let this be to thee the sign, which shall fall upon thy two sons,
Hophni and Phineas, in one day shall they both die by the
sword of men." If thus therefore they shall suffer, who
correct them that are under their charge, with words only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
and not with condign punishment, what shall become of those
who by offending exhort you, and draw others unto wickedness?</p>

<p>&sect; 77. It is apparent also what befell unto the true prophet,
who was sent from Judah to prophesy in Bethel, and
forbidden to taste any meat in that place, after the sign
which he foretold was fulfilled, and after he had restored to
the wicked king his withered hand again, being deceived by
another prophet, as he was termed, and so make to take but
a little bread and water, his host speaking in this sort unto
him: "Thus saith our Lord God: Because thou hast been
disobedient to the mouth of our Lord, and hast not observed
the precept which the Lord thy God hath commanded, and
hast returned, and eaten bread, and drunk water in this
place, in which I have charged thee that thou shouldest
neither eat bread nor drink water, thy body shall not be
buried in the sepulchre of thy forefathers. And so (saith
the scripture) it came to pass, that after he had eaten bread
and drunk water, he made ready his ass, and departed, and a
lion found him in the way and slew him."</p>

<p>&sect; 78. Hear ye also the holy prophet Isaias, how he
speaketh of priests on this wise. "Woe be to the ungodly,
may evil befall him; for the reward of his hands shall light
upon him. Her own exactors have spoiled my people, and
women have borne sway over her. O my people, they who
term thee blessed, themselves deceive thee, and destroy the
way of thy footsteps. Our Lord standeth to judge, and
standeth to judge the people. Our Lord will come unto
judgment with the elders of the people and her princes. Ye
have consumed my vine, the spoil of the poor is in your
house. Why do ye break in pieces my people, and grind the
faces of the poor? saith our Lord of hosts." And also;
"Woe be unto them who compose ungodly laws, and in their
writing have written injustice, that they may oppress the
poor in judgment, and work violence to the cause of the
lowly of my people, that widows may be their prey, and they
make spoil of the orphans; what will ye do in the day of
visitation and calamity approaching from afar off?" And
afterwards: "But these also in regard of wine have been
ignorant, and in respect of drunkenness have wandered
astray; the priests have not understood, because of drunkenness,
and have been swallowed up in wine, they have erred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
in drunkenness, they have not known him who seeth, they
have been ignorant of judgment. For all tables are filled
with the vomit of their uncleanness, in so much as there is
not any free place to be found."</p>

<p>&sect; 79. "Hear therefore the word of our Lord, O ye
deceivers, who bear authority over my people that is in
Jerusalem. For ye have said, We have entered into a truce
with death, and with hell we have made a covenant. The
overflowing scourge when it shall pass forth shall not fall
upon us, because we have placed falsehood for our hope, and
by lying we have been defended." And somewhat after:
"And hail shall overthrow the hope of lying, together with
the defence. Waters shall overflow, and your truce with
death shall be destroyed, and your covenant with hell shall
not continue, when the overflowing scourge shall pass forth;
ye shall also be trodden under foot, whensoever it shall pass
along through you, it shall sweep you away withal." And
again: "And our Lord hath said: Because this people
approacheth with their mouth, and with their lips glorify
me, but their heart is far from me; behold, therefore, I will
cause this people to wonder by a great and stupendous
miracle. For wisdom shall decay and fall away from her
wise men, and the understanding of her sages shall be concealed.
Woe be unto you that are profound in heart, to
conceal counsel from our Lord, whose works are in darkness,
and they say, who seeth us? And who hath known us? for
this thought of yours is perverse." And afterwards: "Thus
saith our Lord, Heaven is my seat, and the earth my footstool.
What is this house that ye will erect unto me, and
what place shall be found for my resting-place? all these
things hath my hand made, and these universally have been
all created, saith our Lord. On whom truly shall I cast
mine eye, but on the humble poor man, and the contrite
in spirit, and him that dreadeth my speeches? he that
sacrificeth an ox, is as he that killeth a man; he that
slaughtereth a beast for sacrifice, is like him who beateth
out the brains of a dog; he that offereth an oblation, is as
he that offereth the blood of a hog; he that is mindful of
frankincense, is as he that honoureth an idol: of all these
things have they made choice in their ways, and in their
abominations hath their soul been delighted."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span></p>

<p>&sect; 80. Hear also what Jeremy, that virgin prophet, speaketh
unto the unwise pastors in this sort: "Thus saith our Lord,
What iniquity have your fathers found in me, because they
have removed themselves far off from me, and walked after
vanity, and are become vain?" And again: "And entering
in, ye have defiled my land, and made mine inheritance
abomination. The priests have not said, Where is our Lord?
and the rulers of the law have not known me, and the pastors
have dealt treacherously against me. Wherefore I will as
yet contend in judgment with you, saith our Lord, and
debate the matter with your children." And a little afterwards:
"Astonishment and wonders have been wrought in
the land. Prophets did preach lying, and priests did applaud
with their hands, and my people have loved such matters.
What therefore shall be done in her last and final ends? To
whom shall I speak and make protestation that he may hear
me? Behold their ears are uncircumcised, and they cannot
hear. Behold the word of our Lord is uttered unto them
for their reproach, and they receive it not: because I will
stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the earth, saith
our Lord. For why, from the lesser even unto the greater,
all study avarice, and from the prophet even unto the priest,
all work deceit, and they cured the contrition of the daughter
of my people, with ignominy, saying, Peace, peace, and peace
there shall not be. Confounded they are, who have wrought
abomination: but they are not with confusion confounded,
and have not understood how to be ashamed. Wherefore
they shall fall among those who are falling, in the time of
their visitation shall they rush headlong down together, saith
our Lord." And again: "All these princes of the declining
sort, walking fraudulently, being brass and iron, are universally
corrupted, the blowing bellows have failed in the
fire, the finer of metals in vain hath melted, their malicious
acts are not consumed, call them refuse and reprobate
silver, because our Lord hath thrown them away." And
after a few words: "I am, I am, I have seen, saith our Lord.
Go your ways to my place in Shilo, where my name hath
inhabited from the beginning, and behold what I have done
thereunto for the malice of my people Israel. And now
because ye have wrought all these works, saith our Lord,
and I have spoken unto you, arising in the morning, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
talking, and yet ye have not heard me, and I have called
you, and yet ye have not answered, I will so deal towards
this house, wherein my name is now called upon, and wherein
ye have confidence, and to this place which I have given unto
you, and to your fathers, as I have done to Shilo, and I will
cast you away from my countenance."</p>

<p>&sect; 81. And again: "My children have departed from me,
and have no abiding, and there is none who any more pitcheth
my tent, and advanceth my pavilion: for the pastors have
dealt fondly and not sought out our Lord. Wherefore they
have not understood, and their flock hath been dispersed."
And a little after: "What is the matter that my beloved
hath in my houses committed many offences? shall the holy
flesh take away thy maliciousness from thee, wherein thou
hast glorified? our Lord shall call thy name a plentiful, fair,
fruitful, goodly olive; at the sound of the speech a mighty
fire hath been inflamed in her, and her orchards have been
quite consumed therewith." And again: "Come ye to me,
and be ye gathered together, all ye beasts of the earth, make
haste to devour. Many pastors have thrown down my vine,
they have trampled my part under foot, they have given over
my portion which was well worthy to be desired, into a
desert of solitariness." And again he speaketh: "Thus
saith our Lord unto this people, which have loved to move
their feet, and not rested, nor yet pleased our Lord; now
shall he remember their iniquities and visit their offences.
Prophets say unto them, Ye shall not see the sword, and
there shall be no famine among you, but our Lord shall give
true peace unto you in this place. And our Lord hath said
unto me, The prophets do falsely foretell in my name; I have
not sent them, nor laid my commandment on them; they
prophesy unto you a lying vision, and divination together
with deceitfulness, and the seducement of their own hearts.
And therefore thus saith our Lord: In sword and famine
shall those prophets be consumed; and the people to whom
they have prophesied shall by means of the famine and sword
be cast out into the streets of Jerusalem, and there shall be
none to bury them."</p>

<p>&sect; 82. And moreover: "Woe be to the pastors who destroy
and rend in pieces the flock of my pasture, saith our
Lord. Thus, therefore, saith our Lord God of Israel, unto<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
the pastors who guide my people, Ye have dispersed my
flock, and cast them forth, and not visited them. Behold I
will visit upon you the malice of your endeavours, saith our
Lord. For the prophet and the priest are both defiled, and
in my house have I found their evil, saith our Lord, and
therefore shall their way be as a slippery place in the dark,
for they shall be thrust forward, and fall down together
therein, for I will bring evils upon them, the year of their
visitation, saith our Lord. And in the prophets of Samaria
I have seen foolishness, and they did prophesy in Baal, and
deceived my people Israel, and in the prophets of Jerusalem,
have I seen the like resemblance, adultery, and the way of
lying, and they have comforted the hands of the vilest offenders,
that every man may not be converted from his malice:
they have been all made to me as Sodom, and the inhabitants
thereof as those of Gomorrah. Thus, therefore, saith
our Lord to the prophets: Behold, I will give them wormwood
for their food, and gall for their drink. For there hath passed
from the prophet of Jerusalem pollution over the whole earth.
Thus saith our Lord of hosts, Listen not to the words of prophets,
who prophesy unto you, and deceive you, for they
speak the vision of their own heart, and not from the mouth
of our Lord. For they say unto those who blaspheme me,
Our Lord hath spoken, peace shall be unto you; and to all
that walk in the wickedness of their own hearts, they have
said, evil shall not fall upon them. For who was present in
the counsel of our Lord, and hath seen and heard his speech,
who hath considered of his word, and hearkened thereunto?
Behold, the whirlwind of the indignation of our Lord
passeth out, and a tempest breaking forth, shall fall upon the
heads of the wicked; the fury of our Lord shall not return,
until the time that he worketh, and until he fulfilleth the
cogitation of his heart. In the last days of all shall ye understand
his counsel."</p>

<p>&sect; 83. And little also do ye conceive and put in execution
that which the holy prophet Joel hath likewise spoken
in admonishment of slothful priests, and lamentation of
the people's suffering for their iniquities, saying: "Awake,
ye who are drunk, from your wine, and weep and bewail ye
all, who have drunk wine even to drunkenness, because joy
and delight are taken away from your mouths. Mourn, ye<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
priests, who serve the altar, because the fields have been
made miserable. Let the earth mourn, because corn hath
become miserable, and wine been dried up, oil diminished,
and husbandmen withered away. Lament ye possessions, in
regard of wheat and barley, because the vintage hath perished
out of the field, the vine withered up, the figs diminished;
the pomegranates, and palm, and apple, and all trees
of the field are withered away, in respect that the children
of men have confounded their joy." All which things are
spiritually to be understood by you, that your souls may not
wither away with so pestilent a famine, for want of the word
of God. And again, "Weep out ye priests, who serve our
Lord, saying, Spare, O Lord, thy people, and give not over
thine inheritance unto reproach, and let not nations hold
dominion over them, that Gentiles may not say, Where is
their God?" And yet ye yield not your ears unto these
sayings, but admit of all matters by which the indignation
of God's fury is more vehemently inflamed.</p>

<p>&sect; 84. With diligence also attend ye what holy Hosea the
prophet hath spoken unto priests of your behaviour. "Hear
these words, O ye priests, and let the house of Israel, together
with the king's house, mark them; fasten ye them in
your ears, for unto you pertaineth judgment, because ye are
made an entangling snare to the espying watch, and as a net
stretched over the toils which the followers of hunting have
framed."</p>

<p>&sect; 85. To you also may this kind of alienation from our
Lord be meant by the prophet Amos, saying, "I have hated
and rejected your festival days, and I will not receive the
savour in your solemn assemblies, because albeit ye offer
your burnt sacrifices and hosts, I will not accept them, and
I will not cast mine eye on the vows of your declaration.
Take away from me the sound of your songs, and the psalm
of your organs I will not hear." For the famine of the
evangelical meat consuming, in your abundance of victuals,
the very bowels of your souls, rageth violently within you,
according as the aforesaid prophet hath foretold, saying,
"Behold, the days shall come, saith our Lord, and I will
send out a famine upon the earth; not the famine of bread,
nor the thirst of water, but a famine in hearing the word
of God, and the waters shall be moved from sea to sea,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
and they shall run over from the north even unto the east,
seeking the word of our Lord, and shall not find it."</p>

<p>&sect; 86. Let holy Micah also pierce your ears, who like a
heavenly trumpet soundeth loudly forth against the deceitful
princes of the people, saying, "Hearken now ye princes
of the house of Jacob, Is it not for you to know judgment,
who hate goodness, and seek after mischief, who pluck their
skins from off men, and their flesh from their bones? Even
as they have eaten the flesh of my people, and flayed their
skins from them, broken their bones to pieces, and hewed
them small as meat to the pot, they shall cry to God, and he
will not hear them, and in that season turn his face away
from them, even as they before have wickedly behaved themselves
in their inventions. Thus speaketh our Lord of the
prophets who seduce my people, who bite with their teeth,
and preach against them peace, and if a man giveth nothing
to stop their mouths, they raise and sanctify a war upon
him. Night shall therefore be unto you in place of a
vision, and darkness unto you in lieu of divination, and
the sun shall set upon your prophets, and the day shall
wax dark upon them, and seeing dreams they shall be
confounded, and the diviners shall be derided, and they
shall speak ill against all men, because there shall not be any
one that will hear them, but that I myself shall do mine uttermost
and strongest endeavour in the spirit of our Lord, in
judgment and in power, that I may declare unto the house
of Jacob their impieties, and to Israel their offences. Hearken,
therefore, unto these words, ye captains of the house of
Jacob, and ye remnants of the house of Israel, who abhor
judgment, and overthrow all righteousness, who build up
Sion in blood, and Jerusalem in iniquities: her rulers did
judge for rewards, and her priests answered for hire, and
her prophets did for money divine, and rested on our Lord,
saying, And is not the Lord among us? Evils shall not fall
upon us. For your cause, therefore, shall Sion be ploughed
up as a field, and Jerusalem as the watch-house of a garden,
and the mountain of the house as the place of a woody wilderness."
And after some words ensuing: "Woe is me for
that I am become as he that gathereth stubble in the harvest,
and a cluster of grapes in the vintage, when the principal
branch is not left to be eaten. Woe is me that a soul hath<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
perished through earthly actions, the reverence of sinners
ariseth even with reverence from the earth, and he appeareth
not that shall use correction among men. All contend
in judgment for blood, and every one with tribulation
afflicteth his neighbour, for mischief he prepareth his
hands."</p>

<p>&sect; 87. Listen ye likewise how the famous prophet Zephaniah
debated also in times past, concerning your revellers
(for he spake of Jerusalem, which is spiritually to be understood
the church or the soul), saying, "O the city that was
beautiful and set at liberty, the confiding dove hath not
hearkened to the voice, nor yet entertained discipline, she
hath not trusted in our Lord, and to her God she hath not
approached." And he showeth the reason why, "Her princes
have been like unto roaring lions, her judges as wolves of
Arabia did not leave towards the morning, her prophets
carrying the spirit of a contemptuous despising man; her
priests did profane what was holy, and dealt wickedly in the
law, but our Lord is upright in the midst of his people, and
in the morning he will not do injustice, in the morning will
he give his judgment."</p>

<p>&sect; 88. But hear ye also blessed Zachariah the prophet, in the
word of God, admonishing you: "For thus saith our
Almighty Lord, Judge ye righteous judgment, and work ye
every one towards his brother mercy and pity, and hurt ye
not through your power the widow, or orphan, or stranger,
or poor man, and let not any man remember in his heart the
malice of his brother; and they have been stubborn not to
observe these, and have yielded their backs to foolishness, and
made heavy their ears that they might not hearken, and framed
their hearts not to be persuaded that they might not listen to
my law and words, which our Almighty Lord hath sent in his
Spirit, through the hands of his former prophets, and mighty
wrath hath been raised by our Almighty Lord." And again;
"Because they who have spoken, have spoken molestations,
and diviners have uttered false visions and deceitful dreams,
and given vain consolations; in respect hereof they are made
as dry as sheep, and are afflicted because no health was to be
found; my wrath is heaped upon the shepherds, and upon
the lambs will I visit." And within a few words after:
"The voice of lamenting pastors, because their greatness is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
become miserable. The voice of roaring lions, because the
fall of Jordan is become miserable: thus saith our Almighty
Lord: They who possessed have murdered, and yet hath it
not repented them, and they who sold them, have said, Our
Lord is blessed and we have been enriched, and their pastors
have suffered nothing concerning them. For which I will
now bear no sparing hand over the inhabitants of the earth,
saith our Lord."</p>

<p>&sect; 89. Hear ye moreover what the holy prophet Malachi
denounceth unto you, saying: "Ye priests who despise my
name, and have said: Wherein do we despise thy name? in
offering on mine altar polluted bread: and ye have said,
Wherein have we polluted it? In that ye have said: The
table of our Lord is as nothing, and have despised such things
as have been placed thereon; because if ye bring what is
blind for an offering, is it not evil? If ye set and apply what is
lame or languishing, is it not evil? Offer therefore the same
unto thy governor, if he will receive it, if he will accept of
thy person, saith our Almighty Lord. And now do ye
humbly pray before the countenance of your God, and
earnestly beseech him (for in your hands have these things
been committed) if happily he will accept of your persons."
And again: "And out of your ravenous theft ye have
brought in the lame and languishing, and brought it in as an
offering. Shall I receive the same at your hands, saith our
Lord? Accursed is the deceitful man who hath in his flock
one of the male kind, and yet making his vow offereth the
feeble unto our Lord, because I am a mighty king, saith our
Lord of hosts, and my name is terrible among the Gentiles.
And now unto you appertaineth this commandment, O ye
priests, if ye will not hear, and resolve in your hearts to yield
glory unto my name, saith our Lord of hosts, I will send
upon you poverty, and accurse your blessings, because ye
have not settled these things on your hearts. Behold I will
stretch out my arm over ye, and disperse upon your countenances
the dung of your solemnities." But that ye may
in the meantime, with more zeal prepare your organs and
instruments of mischief, to be converted into goodness,
hearken ye (if there remain ever so little disposition to listen
in your hearts) what he speaketh of a holy priest, saying
"My covenant of life and peace was with him (for histori<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>cally
he did speak of Levi and Moses): I gave fear unto him,
and he was timorous of me, he dreaded before the countenance
of my name; the law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity
was not found in his lips; he walked with me in peace
and equity, and turned many away from unrighteousness.
For the lips of the priest shall keep knowledge, and
from out of his mouth they shall require the law, because he
is the Angel of our Lord of hosts." And now again he
changeth his style, and ceaseth not to rebuke and reprove
the unrighteous, saying: "Ye have departed from the way,
and scandalized many in the law, and made void my covenant
with Levi, saith our Lord of hosts. In regard whereof
I have also given you over as contemptible and abject among
my people, according as ye have not observed my ways, and
accepted countenance of men in the law. What, is there
not one Father of us all? What, hath not one God created
us? Why therefore doth every one despise his brother?"
And again, "Behold our Lord of hosts will come, and who
can conceive the day of his coming, and who shall endure to
stand to behold him? For he shall pass forth as a burning
fire, and as the fuller's herb, and shall sit melting and trying
silver, and ye shall purge the sons of Levi, and cleanse them
as gold and as silver." And somewhat afterwards: "Your
words have grown strong against me, saith our Lord, and ye
have spoken thus: He is vain who serveth God, and what
profit because we have kept his commandments, and walked
sorrowfully before our Lord of hosts. We shall therefore
now call the arrogant blessed, for because they are erected and
builded up, while they work iniquity, they have tempted
God, and are made safe."</p>

<p>&sect; 90. But hear ye also what Ezechiel the prophet hath
spoken, saying, "Woe upon woe shall come, and messenger
upon messenger shall be, and the vision shall be sought for
of the prophet, and the law shall perish from the priests, and
counsel from the elders." And again: "Thus saith our
Lord: In respect that your speeches are lying, and your
divinations vain. For this cause, behold, I will come unto
you, saith our Lord; I will stretch out my hand on your
prophets, who see lies, and them who speak vain things; in
the discipline of my people they shall not be, and in the
Scripture of the house of Israel, they shall not be written,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
and into the land of Israel they shall not enter, and ye shall
know that I am the Lord, because they have seduced my
people, saying, The peace of our Lord, and there is not the
peace of our Lord. Here have they built the wall; and they
anointed it, and it shall fall." And within some words afterwards:
"Woe be unto these who fashion pillows, apt for
every elbow of the hand, and make veils upon every head
of all ages to the subversion of souls, and the souls of my
people are subverted, and they possess their souls, and contaminated
me unto my people for a handful of barley, and a
piece of bread to the slaughter of the souls, whom it behoved
not to die, and to the delivery of the souls, that were
not fit to live, while ye talk unto my people that listeneth
after vain speeches." And afterwards: "Say, thou son of
man, thou art earth which is not watered with rain, neither
yet hath rain fallen upon thee in the day of wrath, in which
thy princes were in the midst of thee as roaring lions, ravening
on their prey, devouring souls in their potent might, and
receiving rewards, and thy widows were multiplied in the
midst of thee, and her priests have despised my law, and
defiled my holy things. Between holy and polluted, they did
not distinguish, and divided not equally between the unclean
and clean, and from my sabbaths they veiled their eyes, and
in the midst of them they defiled."</p>

<p>&sect; 91. And again: "And I sought among them a man of
upright conversation, and one who should altogether stand
before my face, to prevent the times that might fall upon the
earth, that I should not in the end utterly destroy it, and I
found him not. And I poured out upon it, the whole design
of my mind, in the fire of my wrath for the consuming of
them: I repaid their ways on their heads, saith our Lord."
And somewhat after: "And the word of our Lord was
spoken unto me, saying: O son of man, speak to the children
of my people, and they shalt say unto them: The land
whereupon I shall bring my sword, and the people of the
land shall take some one man among them, and ordain him
to be a watchman over them, and he shall espy the sword
coming upon the land, and sound with his trumpet, and
signify unto the people, whoso truly shall then hear the
sound of the trumpet, and yet hearing shall not beware:

upon his own head, because when he heard the sound of the
trumpet, he was not watchful, his blood shall be upon him,
and this man, for that he hath preserved his own soul, hath
delivered himself. But the watchman if he shall see the
sword coming, and not give notice with his trumpet, and the
people shall not be aware, and the sword coming shall take
away a soul from among them, both the soul itself is caught
a captive for her iniquities, and I will also require her blood
at the hand of the watchman. And thou, O son of man, I
have appointed thee a watchman over the house of Israel,
and if thou shalt hear the word from out of my mouth,
when I shall say to a sinner, Thou shalt die the death, and
yet wilt not speak whereby the wicked may return from his
way: both the unjust himself shall die in his iniquity, and
truly I will require his blood also at thy hands. But if
thou shalt forewarn the wicked of his way, that he may
avoid the same, and he nevertheless will not withdraw
himself from his course, this man shall die in his impiety,
and thou hast preserved thine own soul."</p>

<p>&sect; 92. And so let these few among a multitude of
prophetical testimonies suffice, by which the pride or sloth
of our stubborn priests may be repelled, to the end they
may not suppose that we act rather of our own invention,
but by the authority of the laws, and saints, denounce such
threats against them. And now let us also behold what the
trumpet of the gospel, sounding to the whole world, speaketh
likewise to disordered priests; for as we have often said,
this our discourse tendeth not to treat of them, who obtain
lawfully the apostolical seat, and such as rightly and
skilfully understand how to dispose of their spiritual food
(in time convenient) unto their fellow servants, if yet at this
time there remain any great number of these in this our
country; but we only talk of ignorant and unexpert shepherds,
who leave their flock, and feed on vain matters, and have
not the words of a learned pastor. And therefore it is an
evident token that he is not a lawful pastor, yea not an
ordinary Christian, who rejecteth and denieth these sayings,
which are not so much ours (who of ourselves are very little
worth), as the decrees of the Old and New Testament, even
as one of ours right well doth say, "We do exceedingly
desire that the enemies of the church should also, without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
any manner of truce be our adversaries: and that the
friends and defenders thereof should not only be accounted
our confederates, but also our fathers and governors." For
let every one, with true examination, call his own conscience
unto account, and so shall he easily find, whether according
to true reason he possesseth his priestly chair or no. Let us
see, I say, what the Saviour and Creator of the world hath
spoken. "Ye are," saith he, "the salt of the earth; if that
the salt vanisheth away, wherein shall it be salted? it
prevaileth to no purpose any farther, but that it be cast out
of doors, and trampled under the feet of men."</p>

<p>&sect; 93. This only testimony might abundantly suffice to
confute all such as are impudent; but that it may be yet, by
the words of Christ, more evidently proved with what
intolerable bonds of crimes these false priests entangle and
oppress themselves, some other sayings are also to be
adjoined; for it followeth: "Ye are the light of the world.
A city placed on a mountain cannot be hid: neither do they
light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but upon a
candlestick, that it may shine unto all who are in the house."
What priest therefore of this fashion and time, who is so
possessed with the blindness of ignorance, doth, as the light
of a most bright candle, shine with the lamp of learning and
good works, in any house, to all that sit in the darksome
night? What one is so accounted a safe public and conspicuous
refuge, to all the children universally of the church,
that he may be to his countrymen a defensible and strong
city, situated on the top of a high mountain? Moreover,
which one of them can accomplish one day together, that
which followeth: "Let your light so shine before men, that
they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who
is in heaven:" since rather a certain most obscure cloud of
theirs, and the black night of offences, hang over the island,
in such a manner, that they all turn almost away from the
righteous course, and make them to wander astray through
unpassable and cumbersome paths of wickedness, and so
their heavenly Father is not only by their works not magnified,
but also by the same intolerably blasphemed. These
testimonies of holy scripture, which are either already cited,
or hereafter to be intermixed in this epistle, I would gladly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
wish to interpret in some historical or moral sense, as far as
my meanness would allow.</p>

<p>&sect; 94. But for fear lest this our little work should be
immeasurably tedious unto those who despise, loathe, and
disdain, not so much our speeches as God's sayings, I have
already alleged, and mean hereafter to affirm these sentences
plainly without any circumstance. And to proceed, within
a few words after: "For whoever shall break one of the
least of these commandments, and so instruct men, shall be
called the least in the kingdom of heaven." And again:
"Judge ye not that ye may not be judged; for in what
judgment ye shall judge, ye shall be judged." And which
one, I pray you, of your company will regard this same that
followeth: "But why dost thou see," saith he, "the mote in
thy brother's eye, and considerest not the beam in thine own
eye? or how dost thou say to thy brother, suffer me to cast
the mote out of thine eye, and behold the beam remaineth
still in thine own eye?" Or this which follows: "Do not
give what is holy to dogs, neither yet shall ye cast your
pearls before swine, lest perchance they tread them under
their feet, and turn again and rend you," which hath often
befallen you. And, admonishing the people, that they should
not by deceitful doctors, such as ye, be seduced, he saith:
"Keep yourselves carefully from false prophets, who come
unto you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravenous
wolves: by their fruit shall ye know them. Do men gather
grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? So every good tree
beareth good fruit, and the evil, evil fruit." And somewhat
afterward: "Not every one who saith unto me, Lord, Lord,
shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but whoso doeth the
will of my Father that is in heaven, he shall enter into the
kingdom of heaven."</p>

<p>&sect; 95. And what shall then become of you, who, as the
prophet hath said, believe God only with your lips, and do
not adhere to him with your hearts? And how do ye fulfil
that which followeth: "Behold I send you forth as sheep in
the midst of wolves?" Whereas you act quite contrariwise,
and proceed as wolves against a flock of sheep: or the other
following sentence: "Be ye wise as serpents and simple as
doves?" since ye are only wise to bite others with your
deadly mouths, and not, with the interposition of your whole<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
body, to defend your head, which is Christ, whom with all
the endeavours of your evil actions you tread under foot;
neither yet have ye the simplicity of doves, but the
resemblance rather of the black crow, which taking her
flight out of the ark, that is, the church of God, and finding
the carrion of earthly pleasures, did never with a pure
return back thither again. But let us look on the rest.
"Fear not," saith he, "them who kill the body, but are not
able to slay the soul; but fear him who can overthrow both
soul and body in hell." Revolve in your minds which of
these ye have performed? And what one of you is not
wounded in the very secrets of his heart, by this testimony
following, which our Saviour uttereth unto his apostles, of
evil prelates, saying, "Do ye suffer them, the blind leaders
of the blind, but if the blind be a guide to the blind, both
shall fall into the ditch?" But the people doubtless whom
ye have governed, or rather beguiled, have just occasion to
listen hereunto.</p>

<p>&sect; 96. Mark ye also the words of our Lord speaking unto
his apostles, and to the people, which words likewise (as I
hear) ye yourselves are not ashamed to pronounce often in
public: "Upon the chair of Moses have the scribes and
pharisees sat, observe ye therefore and accomplish all that
they shall speak unto you, but do not according to their
works. For they only speak, but of themselves do nothing."
It is truly to priests a dangerous and superfluous doctrine,
which is overclouded with sinful actions. "Woe be unto
you, hypocrites, who shut up the kingdom of heaven before
men, and neither yourselves enter in, nor yet suffer those
that would to enter in." For ye shall with horrible pains be
tormented, not only in respect of your great offences, which
ye heap up for punishment in the world to come, but also in
regard of those who daily perish through your bad example,
whose blood in the day of judgment shall be required at
your hands.</p>

<p>Yield ye also diligent attention unto the misery, which the
parable setteth before your eyes, that is spoken of the servant,
who saith in his heart, "My Lord delayeth his coming,"
and upon this occasion, perchance, "hath begun to
strike his fellow servants, eating and drinking with drunkards.
The Lord of the same servant, therefore, saith he, will come on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
a day when he doth not expect him, and in an hour whereof
he is ignorant, and will divide him, away from his holy
priests, and will place his portion with the hypocrites (that
is, with them who under the pretence of priesthood do conceal
much iniquity), affirming that there shall be weeping
and gnashing of teeth;" such as they have not experienced
in this present life, either for the daily ruin of the children
of our holy mother church, or for the desire of the kingdom
of heaven.</p>

<p>&sect; 97. But let us see what Paul, the true scholar of Christ,
and master of the Gentiles, who is a mirror of every ecclesiastical
doctor, "Even as I am the disciple of Christ," speaketh
about a work of such importance in his first epistle on
this wise: "Because when they have known God, they have
not magnified him as God, or given thanks unto him; but
vanished in their own cogitations, and their foolish heart is
blinded; affirming themselves to be wise, they are made fools."
Although this seemeth to be spoken unto the Gentiles, look into
it notwithstanding, because it may conveniently be applied to
the priests and people of this age. And after a few words,
"Who have changed," saith he, "the truth of God into lying,
and have reverenced and served the creature rather than the
Creator, who is blessed for ever; therefore hath God given
them over unto passions of ignominy." And again, "And
even as they have not approved themselves to have God in
their knowledge, so God hath yielded them up to a reprobate
sense, that they may do such things as are not convenient,
being replenished with all iniquity, malice, uncleanness of
life, fornication, covetousness, naughtiness, full of envy,
murder (i.e. of the souls of the people), contention, deceit,
wickedness, backbiters, detractors, hateful to God, spiteful,
proud, puffed up, devisers of mischief, disobedient to their
parents, senseless, disordered, without mercy, without affection,
who, when they had known the justice of God, understood
not that they who commit such things, are worthy of
death."</p>

<p>&sect; 98. And now what one of the aforesaid sort hath indeed
been void of all these? And if he were, yet perhaps he
may be caught in the sense of the ensuing sentence, wherein
he saith: "Not only those who do these things, but those
also who consent unto them," for none of them truly are free<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
from this wickedness. And afterwards, "But thou, according
to thy hardness and impenitent heart, dost lay up for
thyself wrath, against the day of wrath, and revelation of
the just judgment of God, who will yield unto every one
according unto his works." And again, "For there is no
acceptation of persons with God. For whosoever have
offended without the law, shall also without the law perish;
whosoever have offended in the law, shall by the law be
judged. For the hearers of the law shall not with God be
accounted just, but the doers of the law shall be justified."
How severe a sentence shall they therefore sustain, who not
only leave undone what they ought to accomplish, and forbear
not what they are forbidden, but also flee away from
the very hearing of the word of God, as from a serpent,
though lightly sounding in their ears.</p>

<p>&sect; 99. But let us pass over to that which followeth to this
effect: "What shall we therefore say, shall we continue
still in sin that grace may abound? God forbid, for we who
are dead to sin, how shall we again live in the same?" And
somewhat afterwards, "Who shall separate us," saith he,
"from the love of Christ, tribulation, or distress, or persecution,
or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or the sword?"
What one, I pray you, of all you, shall with such an
affection be possessed in the inward secret of his heart, since
ye do not only labour for achieving of piety, but also endure
many things for the working of impiety, and offending of
Christ? Or who hath respected this that followeth? "The
night hath passed, and the day approached. Let us therefore
cast off the works of darkness, and put on the armour
of light, even as in the day: let us honestly walk, not in
banqueting, and drunkenness, not in couches, and wantonness,
not in contention, and emulation; but put ye on our
Lord Jesus Christ, and make no care to bestow your flesh in
concupiscences."</p>

<p>&sect; 100. And again, in the first Epistle to the Corinthians,
he saith: "As a wise workmaster have I laid the foundation,
another buildeth thereupon, but let every man consider how
he buildeth thereon. For no other man can lay any other
foundation besides that which is laid, even Christ Jesus.
But if any man buildeth upon this, gold, and silver, precious
stones, hay, wood, stubble, every one's work shall be mani<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>fest;
for the day of our Lord shall declare the same, because
it shall be revealed in fire, and the fire shall prove what
every man's work is. If any man's work shall remain, all
by the fire shall be adjudged. Whoso shall build thereupon,
shall receive reward. If any man's work shall burn, he
shall suffer detriment. Know ye not that ye are the temple
of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? But
if any man violate the temple of God, God will destroy
him." And again, "If any man seemeth to be wise among
you in this world, let him be made a fool that he may become
wise. For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with
God." And within a few words afterwards, "Your glorying
is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven corrupteth the
whole mass? Purge ye, therefore, the old leaven that ye
may be a new sprinkling." How shall the old leaven, which
is sin, be purged away, that from day to day with your uttermost
endeavours is increased? And yet again, "I have
written unto you in mine epistle, that ye be not intermingled
with fornicators, not truly the fornicators of
this world, or the avaricious, ravenous, or idolatrous,
otherwise ye ought to depart out of this world. But
now have I written unto you, that ye be not intermingled, if
any one is named a brother, and be a fornicator, or avaricious,
or an idolator, or a slanderer, or a drunkard, or ravenous,
with such an one ye should not so much as eat." But a
felon condemneth not his fellow thief for stealing, or other
open robbery, whom he rather liketh, defendeth, and loveth,
as a companion of his offence.</p>

<p>&sect; 101. Also in his second epistle unto the Corinthians;
"Having therefore," saith he, "this administration, according
as we have obtained mercy, let us not fail, but let us cast
away the secrets of shame, not walking in subtility, nor yet
corrupting the word of God," (that is, by evil example and
flattery.) And in that which followeth, he thus discourseth
of wicked teachers, saying: "For such false apostles are
deceitful workmen, transfiguring themselves into the apostles
of Christ. And no wonder: for Satan himself transfigureth
himself into an angel of light. It is not much therefore if
his ministers are transfigured as ministers of justice, whose
end will be according unto their works."</p>

<p>&sect; 102. Hear likewise what he speaketh unto the Ephe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>sians;
and consider if ye find not your consciences attainted
as culpable of this that followeth? where he denounceth
thus: "I say and testify this in our Lord, that ye do not as
now walk like the Gentiles in the vanity of their own sense,
having their understanding obscured with darkness, alienated
from the way of God, through ignorance, which remaineth
in them in regard of the blindness of their heart, who
despairing, have yielded themselves over to uncleanness of
life, for the working of all filthiness and avarice." And
which of ye hath willingly fulfilled that which next ensueth?
"Therefore be ye not made unwise, but understanding what
is the will of God, and be ye not drunk with wine, wherein
there is riotousness, but be ye fulfilled with the Holy
Ghost."</p>

<p>&sect; 103. Or that which he saith to the Thessalonians.
"For neither have we been with you at any time in the
speech of flattery, as yourselves do know; neither upon
occasion of avarice, neither seeking to be glorified by men,
neither by you, nor any others, when we might be honoured,
as other apostles of Christ. But we have been made as
little ones in the midst of you; or even as the nurse
cherisheth her small tender children, so desiring you, we
would very gladly deliver unto you, not only the gospel, but
also our very lives." If in all things ye retained this
affection of the apostle, then might ye be likewise assured,
that ye lawfully possessed his chair. Or how have ye
observed this that followeth? "Ye know," saith he, "what
precepts I have delivered unto you. This is the will of our
Lord, your sanctification, that ye abstain from fornication;
and that every one of you know how to possess his own
vessel, in honour and sanctification, not in the passion of
desire, like the Gentiles who are ignorant of God; and that
none of you do encroach upon or circumvent his brother in
his business, because our Lord is the revenger of all these.
For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto
sanctification. Therefore whoso despiseth these, doth not
despise man, but God." What one also among you hath
advisedly and warily kept this that ensueth: "Mortify
therefore your members which are upon the earth, fornication,
uncleanness of life, lust, and evil concupiscence, for which
the wrath of God hath come upon the children of diffidence?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
Ye perceive therefore upon what offences the wrath of God
doth chiefly arise.</p>

<p>&sect; 104. In which respect hear likewise what the same
holy apostle, with a prophetical spirit, foretelleth of you, and
such as yourselves, writing plainly in this sort to Timothy:
"For know you this, that in the last days there shall be
dangerous times at hand. For men shall be self-lovers,
covetous, puffed up, proud, blasphemous, disobedient to their
parents, ungrateful, wicked, without affection, incontinent,
unmeek, without benignity, betrayers, froward, lofty, rather
lovers of sensual pleasures, than of God, having a show of
piety, but renouncing the virtue thereof." Avoid thou these
men, even as the prophet saith: "I have hated the congregation
of the malicious, and with the wicked I will not
sit." And a little after, he uttereth that (which in our age
we behold to increase), saying: "Ever learning, and never
attaining unto the knowledge of truth; for even as Jannes
and Mambres resisted Moses, so do these also withstand the
truth: men corrupted in mind, reprobate against faith, but
they shall prosper no further; for their folly shall be manifest
unto all, as theirs likewise was."</p>

<p>&sect; 105. And evidently doth he also declare how priests in
their office ought to behave themselves, writing thus to
Titus: "Show thyself an example of good works, in
learning, in integrity, in gravity, having thy word sound
without offence, that he who standeth on the adverse part
may be afraid, having no evil to speak of us." And moreover
he saith unto Timothy, "Labour thou as a good soldier of
Christ Jesus; no man fighting in God's quarrel entangleth
himself in worldly business, that he may please him unto
whom he hath approved himself; for whoso striveth in the
lists for the mastery, receiveth not the crown, unless he hath
lawfully contended." This is his exhortation to the good.
Other matter also which the same epistles contain, is a
threatening advertisement to the wicked (such as yourselves,
in the judgment of all understanding persons, appear to be).
"If any one," saith he, "teacheth otherwise, and doth not
peaceably assent to the sound sayings of our Lord Jesus
Christ, and that doctrine which is according to piety, he is
proud, having no knowledge, but languishing about questions,
and contentions of words, out of which do spring envies,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
debates, blasphemies, evil suspicions, conflicts of men
corrupted in mind, who are deprived of truth, esteeming
commodity to be piety."</p>

<p>&sect; 106. But why in using these testimonies, here and
there dispersed, are we any longer, as it were, tossed up and
down in the silly boat of our simple understanding, on the
waves of sundry interpretations? We have now therefore
at length thought it necessary to have recourse to those
lessons,<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> which are gathered out of Holy Scriptures, to the
end that they should not only be rehearsed, but also be
assenting and assisting unto the benediction, wherewith the
hands of priests, and others of inferior sacred orders, are
first consecrated, and that thereby they may continually be
warned never, by degenerating from their priestly dignity,
to digress from the commandments, which are faithfully contained
in the same; so as it may be plain and apparent unto
all, that everlasting torments are reserved for them, and that
they are not priests, or the servants of God, who do not
with their utmost power follow and fulfil the instructions
and precepts. Wherefore let us hear what the prince of the
apostles, Saint Peter, hath signified about this so weighty a
matter, saying: "Blessed be God, and the Father of our
Lord Jesus Christ, who through his mercy hath regenerated
us into the hope of eternal life, by the resurrection of our
Lord Jesus Christ from the dead, into an inheritance which
can never corrupt, never wither, neither be defiled, preserved
in heaven for you, who are kept in the virtue of God;" why
then do ye fondly violate such an inheritance, which is not
as an earthly one, transitory, but immortal and eternal?
And somewhat afterwards: "For which cause be ye girded
in the loins of your mind, sober, perfectly hoping in that
grace which is offered to you in the revelation of Jesus
Christ:" examine ye now the depths of your hearts,
whether ye be sober and do perfectly preserve the grace of
priesthood, which shall be duly discussed and decided in the
revelation of our Lord. And again he saith: "As children
of the benediction, not configuring yourselves to those
former desires of your ignorance; but according unto him
who hath called you holy, be ye also holy in all conversation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
For which cause it is written, Be ye holy, because I am
holy." Which one of you, I pray, hath with his whole
mind so pursued sanctity, that he hath earnestly hastened, as
much as in him lay, to fulfil the same? But let us behold
what in the second lesson of the same apostle is contained:
"My dearest," saith he, "sanctify your souls for the
obedience of faith, through the Spirit, in charity, in brotherhood,
loving one another out of a true heart perpetually, as
born again not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible,
through the word of God, living and remaining for
ever."</p>

<p>&sect; 107. These are truly the commandments of the apostle;
and read in the day of your ordination, to the end ye should
inviolably observe the same, but they are not fulfilled by you
in discretion and judgment, nay not so much as duly considered
or understood. And afterwards: "Laying therefore
aside all malice, and all deceits, and dissemblings, envy, and
detractions, as infants newly born, reasonable and without
guile covet ye milk, that ye may thereby grow to salvation,
because our Lord is sweet." Consider ye also in your minds,
if these sayings which have sounded in your deaf ears have
not often likewise been trodden by you under foot: and
again: "Ye truly are the chosen lineage, the royal priesthood,
the holy nation, the people for adoption, that ye may
declare his virtues who hath called you out of darkness into
his marvellous light." But truly by you are not only the
virtues of God not declared and made more glorious, but also
through your wicked examples are they (by such as have not
perfect belief) despised. Ye have perchance at the same time
likewise heard, what is read in the lesson of the Acts, on
this wise: "Peter arising in the midst of the disciples said:
Men and brethren, it is expedient that the Scripture be
fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost hath by the mouth of David
foretold of Judas." And a little after: "This man therefore
purchased a field, of the reward of iniquity." This have ye
heard with a careless or rather blockish heart, as though the
reading thereof nothing at all appertained unto yourselves.
What one of you (I pray you) doth not seek the field of the
reward of iniquity? For Judas robbed and pillaged the
purse, and ye spoil and waste the sacred gifts and treasures
of the church, together with the souls of her children. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
went to the Jews to make a market of God, ye pass to the
tyrants, and their father the devil, that ye may despise
Christ. <i>He</i> set to sale the Saviour of the world for thirty
pence, and <i>you</i> do so even for one poor halfpenny.</p>

<p>&sect; 108. What need many words? The example of Matthias
is apparently laid before you for your confusion, who
was chosen into his place, not by his own proper will, but
by the election of the holy apostles, or rather the judgment
of Christ, whereat ye being blinded, do not perceive how far
ye run astray from his merits, while ye fall wilfully and
headlong into the manners and affection of Judas the traitor.
It is therefore manifest that he who wittingly from his heart
termeth you priests, is not himself a true and worthy Christian.
And now I will assuredly speak what I think: this
reprehension might have been framed after a milder fashion,
but what availeth it to touch only with the hand, or dress
with gentle ointment, that wound which with imposthumation
or stinking corruption is now grown so horrible, that it
requireth the searing iron, or the ordinary help of the fire,
if happily by any means it may be cured, the diseased in the
meanwhile not seeking a medicine, and the physician much
erring from a rightful remedy? O ye enemies of God, and
not priests! O ye traders of wickedness, and not bishops!
O ye betrayers, and not successors of the holy apostles! O
ye adversaries, and not servants of Christ! Ye have certainly
heard at the least, the sound of the words, which are in the
second lesson taken out of the apostle Saint Paul, although
ye have no way observed the admonitions and virtue of them,
but even as statues (that neither see nor hear) stood that day
at the altar, while both then, and continually since he hath
thundered in your ears, saying: "Brethren, it is a faithful
speech, and worthy of all acceptance." He called it faithful
and worthy, but ye have despised it as unfaithful and unworthy.
"If any man desireth a bishopric, he desireth a
good work." Ye do mightily covet a bishopric in respect of
avarice, but not for spiritual convenience and for the good
work which is suitable to the place, ye want it. "It behoveth
therefore such a one to be free from all cause of reprehension."
At this saying we have more need to shed tears than utter
words; for it is as much as if the apostle had said, he ought
to be of all others most free from occasion of rebuke. "The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
husband of one wife," which is likewise so condemned among
us, as if that word had never proceeded from him; "Sober,
wise;" yea, which of ye hath once desired to have these
virtues engrafted in him, "using hospitality." For this, if
perchance it hath been found among you, yet being nevertheless
rather done to purchase the favour of the people, than
to accomplish the commandment, it is of no avail, our Lord
and Saviour saying thus: "Verily, I say unto you, they have
received their reward." Moreover, "A man adorned, not
given to wine; no fighter, but modest; not contentious, not
covetous:" O lamentable change! O horrible contempt of
the heavenly commandments! And do ye not continually
use the force of your words and actions, for the overthrowing
or rather overwhelming of these, for whose defence and confirmation,
if need had required, ye ought to have suffered
pains, yea, and to have lost your very lives.</p>

<p>&sect; 109. But let us see what followeth: "Well governing,"
saith he, "his house, having his children subjected with all
chastity." Imperfect therefore is the chastity of the parents,
if the children be not also endued with the same. But how
shall it be, where neither the father, nor the son, depraved
by the example of his evil parent, is found to be chaste?
"But if any one knoweth not how to rule over his own
house, how shall he employ his care over the church of
God?" These are the words, that with apparent effects,
should be made good and approved. "Deacons in like
manner, that they should be chaste, not doubled tongued,
not overgiven to much wine, not followers of filthy gain,
having the mystery of faith in a preconscience, and let these
also be first approved, and so let them administer, having no
offence." And now trembling truly to make any longer stay
on these matters, I can for a conclusion affirm one thing
certainly, which is, that all these are changed into contrary
actions, in so much that clerks (which not without grief of
heart, I here confess,) are shameless and deceitful in their
speeches, given to drinking, covetous of filthy lucre, having
faith (or to say more truly) unfaithfulness in an impure conscience,
ministering not upon probation of their good works,
but upon foreknowledge of their evil actions, and being thus
defiled with innumerable offences, they are notwithstanding
admitted unto the holy office; ye have likewise heard on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
same day (wherein ye should with far more right and reason
have been drawn to prison or punishment, than preferred
unto priesthood) when our Lord demanded whom his disciples
supposed him to be, how Peter answered, "Thou art Christ,
the Son of the living God;" and our Lord in respect of such
his confession, said unto him: "Blessed art thou, Simon
Bar-jonas, because flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto
thee, but my Father who is in heaven." Peter therefore,
instructed by God the Father, did rightly confess Christ;
but ye being taught by the devil your father, do, with your
lewd actions, wickedly deny our Saviour. It is said to the
true priest, "Thou art Peter, and upon this rock will I build
my church:" but ye resembled "the foolish man, who hath
builded his house upon the sand." And verily it is to be
noted, that God joineth not in the workmanship with the
unwise, when they build their house upon the deceitful
uncertainty of the sands, according unto that saying: "They
have made kings unto themselves, and not by me." Similarly
that (which followeth) soundeth in like sort, speaking thus:
"And the gates of hell (whereby infernal sins are to be
understood) shall not prevail." But of your frail and deadly
frame, mark what is pronounced: "The floods came, and the
winds blew, and dashed upon that house and it fell, and great
was the ruin thereof." To Peter and his successors, our
Lord doth say, "And I will give unto thee the keys of the
kingdom of heaven." But unto you, "I know you not,
depart from me all ye workers of iniquity," that being
separated with the goats of the left hand, ye may together
with them go into eternal fire. It is also promised unto
every good priest, "Whatsoever thou shalt loose upon earth,
shall be likewise loosed in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt
bind upon earth, shall be in like sort bound in heaven." But
how shall ye loose any thing, that it may be loosed also in
heaven, since yourselves for your sins are severed from
heaven, and hampered in the bands of your own heinous
offences, as Solomon saith, "With the cords of his sins,
every one is tied?" And with what reason shall ye bind
any thing on this earth, that above this world may be likewise
bound, unless it be your only selves, who, entangled in
your iniquities, are so detained on this earth, that ye cannot
ascend into heaven, but without your conversion unto our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
Lord in this life, will fall down into the miserable prison of
hell?</p>

<p>&sect; 110. Neither yet let any priest flatter himself upon the
knowledge of the particular cleanness of his own body, since
their souls (over whom he hath government) shall in the day
of judgment be required at his hands as the murderer of
them, if any through his ignorance, sloth, or fawning adulation,
have perished, because the stroke of death is not less
terrible, that is given by a good man, than that which is inflicted
by an evil person; otherwise would the apostle never
have said that which he left unto his successors, as a fatherly
legacy, "I am clear and clean from the blood of all: for I
have not forborne to declare unto you all the counsel of
God." Being therefore mightily drunken with the use and
custom of sins, and extremely overwhelmed with the waves
(as it were) of increasing offences, seek ye now forthwith the
uttermost endeavours of your minds (after this your shipwreck),
that one plank of repentance which is left, whereby
ye may escape and swim to the land of the living, that from
you may be turned away the wrath of our Lord, who saith,
"I will not the death of a sinner: but that he may be converted
and live." And may the same Almighty God, of all
consolation and mercy, preserve his few good pastors from
all evil, and (the common enemy being overcome) make them
free inhabitants of the heavenly city of Jerusalem, which is
the congregation of all saints; grant this, O Father, Son,
and Holy Ghost, to whom be honour and glory, world without
end. Amen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span></p>

<h2>NENNIUS'S</h2>

<h2>HISTORY OF THE BRITONS.</h2>

<h3>I.&mdash;THE PROLOGUE.</h3>


<p>&sect; 1. Nennius, the lowly minister and servant of the servants
of God, by the grace of God, disciple of St. Elbotus,<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>
to all the followers of truth sendeth health.</p>

<p>Be it known to your charity, that being dull in intellect
and rude of speech, I have presumed to deliver these things
in the Latin tongue, not trusting to my own learning, which
is little or none at all, but partly from traditions of our ancestors,
partly from writings and monuments of the ancient
inhabitants of Britain, partly from the annals of the Romans,
and the chronicles of the sacred fathers, Isidore, Hieronymus,
Prosper, Eusebius, and from the histories of the Scots and
Saxons, although our enemies, not following my own inclinations,
but, to the best of my ability, obeying the commands
of my seniors; I have lispingly put together this history
from various sources, and have endeavoured, from shame, to
deliver down to posterity the few remaining ears of corn
about past transactions, that they might not be trodden under
foot, seeing that an ample crop has been snatched away
already by the hostile reapers of foreign nations. For many
things have been in my way, and I, to this day, have hardly
been able to understand, even superficially, as was necessary,
the sayings of other men; much less was I able in my
own strength, but like a barbarian, have I murdered and
defiled the language of others. But I bore about with
me an inward wound, and I was indignant, that the name
of my own people, formerly famous and distinguished,
should sink into oblivion, and like smoke be dissipated.
But since, however, I had rather myself be the historian
of the Britons than nobody, although so many are to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
found who might much more satisfactorily discharge the
labour thus imposed on me; I humbly entreat my readers,
whose ears I may offend by the inelegance of my words, that
they will fulfil the wish of my seniors, and grant me the
easy task of listening with candour to my history. For
zealous efforts very often fail: but bold enthusiasm, were it
in its power, would not suffer me to fail. May, therefore,
candour be shown where the inelegance of my words is insufficient,
and may the truth of this history, which my rustic
tongue has ventured, as a kind of plough, to trace out in
furrows, lose none of its influence from that cause, in the
ears of my hearers. For it is better to drink a wholesome
draught of truth from a humble vessel, than poison mixed
with honey from a golden goblet.</p>

<p>&sect; 2. And do not be loath, diligent reader, to winnow my
chaff, and lay up the wheat in the storehouse of your memory:
for truth regards not who is the speaker, nor in what manner
it is spoken, but that the thing be true; and she does not
despise the jewel which she has rescued from the mud, but
she adds it to her former treasures.</p>

<p>For I yield to those who are greater and more eloquent
than myself, who, kindled with generous ardour, have endeavoured
by Roman eloquence to smooth the jarring elements
of their tongue, if they have left unshaken any pillar
of history which I wished to see remain. This history
therefore has been compiled from a wish to benefit my inferiors,
not from envy of those who are superior to me, in the
858th year of our Lord's incarnation, and in the 24th year
of Mervin, king of the Britons, and I hope that the prayers
of my betters will be offered up for me in recompence of my
labour. But this is sufficient by way of preface. I shall
obediently accomplish the rest to the utmost of my power.</p>

<h3>II.&mdash;THE APOLOGY OF NENNIUS.</h3>


<p>Here begins the apology of Nennius, the historiographer
of the Britons, of the race of the Britons.</p>

<p>&sect; 3. I, Nennius, disciple of St. Elbotus, have endeavoured to
write some extracts which the dulness of the British nation
had cast away, because teachers had no knowledge, nor gave
any information in their books about this island of Britain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
But I have got together all that I could find as well from the
annals of the Romans as from the chronicles of the sacred
fathers, Hieronymus, Eusebius, Isidorus, Prosper, and from
the annals of the Scots and Saxons, and from our ancient
traditions. Many teachers and scribes have attempted to
write this, but somehow or other have abandoned it from its
difficulty, either on account of frequent deaths, or the often
recurring calamities of war. I pray that every reader who
shall read this book, may pardon me, for having attempted,
like a chattering jay, or like some weak witness, to write
these things, after they had failed. I yield to him who knows
more of these things than I do.</p>

From Moses to Solomon, and the first building of the temple,
four hundred and forty-eight. From Solomon to the
rebuilding of the temple, which was under Darius, king of
the Persians, six hundred and twelve years are computed.
From Darius to the ministry of our Lord Jesus Christ, and
to the fifteenth year of the emperor Tiberius, are five hundred
and forty-eight years. So that from Adam to the
ministry of Christ and the fifteenth year of the emperor
Tiberius, are five thousand two hundred and twenty-eight
years. From the passion of Christ are completed nine hundred
and forty-six; from his incarnation, nine hundred and
seventy-six: being the fifth year of Edmund, king of the

Roman consul. Taken from the south-west point it inclines
a little towards the west, and to its northern extremity measures
eight hundred miles, and is in breadth two hundred.
It contains thirty-three cities,<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> viz.</p>

<p>These are the names of the ancient cities of the island of
Britain. It has also a vast many promontories, and castles
innumerable, built of brick and stone. Its inhabitants consist
of four different people; the Scots, the Picts, the Saxons,
and the ancient Britons.</p>

<p>&sect; 8. Three considerable islands belong to it; one, on the
south, opposite the Armorican shore, called Wight;<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> another
between Ireland and Britain, called Eubonia or Man;
and another directly north, beyond the Picts, named Orkney;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
and hence it was anciently a proverbial expression, in reference
to its kings and rulers, "He reigned over Britain and
its three islands."</p>

<p>&sect; 9. It is fertilized by several rivers, which traverse it in
all directions, to the east and west, to the south and north;
but there are two pre-eminently distinguished among the
rest, the Thames and the Severn, which formerly, like the
two arms of Britain, bore the ships employed in the conveyance
of the riches acquired by commerce. The Britons were
once very populous, and exercised extensive dominion from
sea to sea.</p>

<p>&sect; 10.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> Respecting the period when this island became inhabited
subsequently to the flood, I have seen two distinct
relations. According to the annals of the Roman history,
the Britons deduce their origin both from the Greeks and
Romans. On the side of the mother, from Lavinia, the
daughter of Latinus, king of Italy, and of the race of Silvanus,
the son of Inachus, the son of Dardanus; who was the
son of Saturn, king of the Greeks, and who, having possessed
himself of a part of Asia, built the city of Troy.
Dardanus was the father of Troius, who was the father of
Priam and Anchises; Anchises was the father of &AElig;neas,
who was the father of Ascanius and Silvius; and this Silvius
was the son of &AElig;neas and Lavinia, the daughter of the
king of Italy. From the sons of &AElig;neas and Lavinia descended
Romulus and Remus, who were the sons of the holy
queen Rhea, and the founders of Rome. Brutus was consul
when he conquered Spain, and reduced that country to a
Roman province. He afterwards subdued the island of
Britain, whose inhabitants were the descendants of the
Romans, from Silvius Posthumus. He was called <i>Posthumus</i>
because he was born after the death of &AElig;neas his father;
and his mother Lavinia concealed herself during her pregnancy;
he was called <i>Silvius</i>, because he was born in a wood.
Hence the Roman kings were called Silvan, and the Britons
who sprang from him; but they were called Britons from
Brutus, and rose from the family of Brutus.</p>

<p>&AElig;neas, after the Trojan war, arrived with his son in Italy;
and having vanquished Turnus, married Lavinia, the daugh<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>ter
of king Latinus, who was the son of Faunas, the son of
Picus, the son of Saturn. After the death of Latinus, &AElig;neas
obtained the kingdom of the Romans, and Lavinia brought
forth a son, who was named Silvius. Ascanius founded
Alba, and afterwards married. And Lavinia bore to &AElig;neas
a son, named Silvius; but Ascanius<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> married a wife, who
conceived and became pregnant. And &AElig;neas, having been
informed that his daughter-in-law was pregnant, ordered his
son to send his magician to examine his wife, whether the child
conceived were male or female. The magician came and examined
the wife and pronounced it to be a son, who should
become the most valiant among the Italians, and the most
beloved of all men.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> In consequence of this prediction, the
magician was put to death by Ascanius; but it happened
that the mother of the child dying at its birth, he was named
Brutus; and after a certain interval, agreeably to what the
magician had foretold, whilst he was playing with some
others he shot his father with an arrow, not intentionally but
by accident.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> He was, for this cause, expelled from Italy,
and came to the islands of the Tyrrhene sea, when he was
exiled on account of the death of Turnus, slain by &AElig;neas.
He then went among the Gauls, and built the city of the
Turones, called Turnis.<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> At length he came to this island,
named from him Britannia, dwelt there, and filled it with his
own descendants, and it has been inhabited from that time to
the present period.</p>

<p>&sect; 11. &AElig;neas reigned over the Latins three years; Ascanius
thirty-three years; after whom Silvius reigned twelve
years, and Posthumus thirty-nine<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> years: the latter, from
whom the kings of Alba are called Silvan, was brother to
Brutus, who governed Britain at the time Eli the high-priest
judged Israel, and when the ark of the covenant was taken
by a foreign people. But Posthumus his brother reigned
among the Latins.</p>

<p>&sect; 12. After an interval of not less than eight hundred
years, came the Picts, and occupied the Orkney Islands:
whence they laid waste many regions, and seized those on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
the left hand side of Britain, where they still remain, keeping
possession of a third part of Britain to this day.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<p>&sect; 13. Long after this, the Scots arrived in Ireland from
Spain. The first that came was Partholomus,<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> with a
thousand men and women; these increased to four thousand;
but a mortality coming suddenly upon them, they all
perished in one week. The second was Nimech, the son of
...,<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> who, according to report, after having been at
sea a year and a half, and having his ships shattered, arrived
at a port in Ireland, and continuing there several years,
returned at length with his followers to Spain. After
these came three sons of a Spanish soldier with thirty ships,
each of which contained thirty wives; and having remained
there during the space of a year, there appeared to them, in
the middle of the sea, a tower of glass, the summit of
which seemed covered with men, to whom they often spoke,
but received no answer. At length they determined to
besiege the tower; and after a year's preparation, advanced
towards it, with the whole number of their ships, and all
the women, one ship only excepted, which had been
wrecked, and in which were thirty men, and as many
women; but when all had disembarked on the shore which
surrounded the tower, the sea opened and swallowed them
up. Ireland, however, was peopled, to the present period,
from the family remaining in the vessel which was wrecked.
Afterwards, others came from Spain, and possessed themselves
of various parts of Britain.</p>

<p>&sect; 14. Last of all came one Hoctor,<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> who continued there,
and whose descendants remain there to this day. Istoreth,
the son of Istorinus, with his followers, held Dalrieta; Buile
had the island Eubonia, and other adjacent places. The
sons of Liethali<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> obtained the country of the Dimet&aelig;, where
is a city called Menavia,<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> and the province Guiher and
Cetgueli,<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> which they held till they were expelled from

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span></p><p>&sect; 15. According to the most learned among the Scots, if
any one desires to learn what I am now going to state,
Ireland was a desert, and uninhabited, when the children of
Israel crossed the Red Sea, in which, as we read in the
Book of the Law, the Egyptians who followed them were
drowned. At that period, there lived among this people,
with a numerous family, a Scythian of noble birth, who had
been banished from his country, and did not go to pursue
the people of God. The Egyptians who were left, seeing
the destruction of the great men of their nation, and fearing
lest he should possess himself of their territory, took counsel
together, and expelled him. Thus reduced, he wandered
forty-two years in Africa, and arrived, with his family, at
the altars of the Philistines, by the Lake of Osiers. Then
passing between Rusicada and the hilly country of Syria,
they travelled by the river Malva through Mauritania as far
as the Pillars of Hercules; and crossing the Tyrrhene Sea,
landed in Spain, where they continued many years, having
greatly increased and multiplied. Thence, a thousand and two
years after the Egyptians were lost in the Red Sea, they passed
into Ireland, and the district of Dalrieta.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> At that period, Brutus,
who first exercised the consular office, reigned over the
Romans; and the state, which before was governed by regal
power, was afterwards ruled, during four hundred and forty-seven
years, by consuls, tribunes of the people, and dictators.</p>

<p>The Britons came to Britain in the third age of the world;
and in the fourth, the Scots took possession of Ireland.</p>

<p>The Britons who, suspecting no hostilities, were unprovided
with the means of defence, were unanimously and
incessantly attacked, both by the Scots from the west, and
by the Picts from the north. A long interval after this, the
Romans obtained the empire of the world.</p>

<p>&sect; 16. From the first arrival of the Saxons into Britain,
to the fourth year of king Mermenus are computed four
hundred and twenty-eight years; from the nativity of our
Lord to the coming of St. Patrick among the Scots, four
hundred and five years; from the death of St. Patrick to
that of St. Bridget, forty years; and from the birth of
Columcille<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> to the death of St. Bridget four years.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span></p><p>&sect; 17. I have learned another account of this Brutus from
the ancient books of our ancestors.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> After the deluge, the
three sons of Noah severally occupied three different parts
of the earth: Shem extended his borders into Asia, Ham
into Africa, and Japheth into Europe.</p>

<p>The first man that dwelt in Europe was Alanus, with his
three sons, Hisicion, Armenon, and Neugio. Hisicion had
four sons, Francus, Romanus, Alamanus, and Brutus.
Armenon had five sons, Gothus, Valagothus, Cibidus,
Burgundus, and Longobardus. Neugio had three sons,
Vandalus, Saxo, and Boganus. From Hisicion arose four
nations&mdash;the Franks, the Latins, the Germans, and Britons:
from Armenon, the Gothi, Valagothi, Cibidi, Burgundi, and
Longobardi: from Neugio, the Bogari, Vandali, Saxones,
and Tarinegi. The whole of Europe was subdivided into
these tribes.</p>

<p>Alanus is said to have been the son of Fethuir;<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> Fethuir

Ethec, Ethec of Ooth, Ooth of Aber, Aber of Ra, Ra of
Esraa, Esraa of Hisrau, Hisrau of Bath, Bath of Jobath,
Jobath of Joham, Joham of Japheth, Japheth of Noah,
Noah of Lamech, Lamech of Mathusalem, Mathusalem of
Enoch, Enoch of Jared, Jared of Malalehel, Malalehel of
Cainan, Cainan of Enos, Enos of Seth, Seth of Adam, and
Adam was formed by the living God. We have obtained
this information respecting the original inhabitants of Britain
from ancient tradition.</p>

<p>&sect; 18. The Britons were thus called from Brutus: Brutus
was the son of Hisicion, Hisicion was the son of Alanus,
Alanus was the son of Rhea Silvia, Rhea Silvia was the
daughter of Numa Pompilius, Numa was the son of
Ascanius, Ascanius of Eneas, Eneas of Anchises, Anchises
of Troius, Troius of Dardanus, Dardanus of Flisa, Flisa of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
Juuin, Juuin of Japheth; but Japheth had seven sons;
from the first, named Gomer, descended the Galli; from the
second, Magog, the Scythi and Gothi; from the third,
Madian, the Medi; from the fourth, Juuan, the Greeks;
from the fifth, Tubal, arose the Hebrei, Hispani, and Itali;
from the sixth, Mosoch, sprung the Cappadoces; and
from the seventh, named Tiras, descended the Thraces:
these are the sons of Japheth, the son of Noah, the son of
Lamech.</p>

<p>&sect; 19.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> The Romans having obtained the dominion of the
world, sent legates or deputies to the Britons to demand of
them hostages and tribute, which they received from all
other countries and islands; but they, fierce, disdainful, and
haughty, treated the legation with contempt.</p>

<p>Then Julius C&aelig;sar, the first who had acquired absolute
power at Rome, highly incensed against the Britons, sailed
with sixty vessels to the mouth of the Thames, where they
suffered shipwreck whilst he fought against Dolobellus,<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> (the
proconsul of the British king, who was called Belinus,<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> and
who was the son of Minocannus who governed all the
islands of the Tyrrhene Sea), and thus Julius C&aelig;sar
returned home without victory, having had his soldiers slain,
and his ships shattered.</p>

<p>&sect; 20. But after three years he again appeared with a
large army, and three hundred ships, at the mouth of the
Thames, where he renewed hostilities. In this attempt
many of his soldiers and horses were killed; for the same
consul had placed iron pikes in the shallow part of the
river, and this having been effected with so much skill and
secrecy as to escape the notice of the Roman soldiers, did
them considerable injury; thus C&aelig;sar was once more
compelled to return without peace or victory. The Romans
were, therefore, a third time sent against the Britons; and
under the command of Julius, defeated them near a place
called Trinovantum [London], forty-seven years before the
birth of Christ, and five thousand two hundred and twelve
years from the creation.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span></p><p>Julius was the first exercising supreme power over the
Romans who invaded Britain: in honour of him the Romans
decreed the fifth month to be called after his name. He was
assassinated in the Curia, in the ides of March, and Octavius
Augustus succeeded to the empire of the world. He
was the only emperor who received tribute from the Britons,
according to the following verse of Virgil:</p>

<p class="center">
"Purpurea intexti tollunt aul&aelig;a Britanni."<br />
</p>

<p>&sect; 21. The second after him, who came into Britain, was
the emperor Claudius, who reigned forty-seven years after
the birth of Christ. He carried with him war and devastation;
and, though not without loss of men, he at length conquered
Britain. He next sailed to the Orkneys, which he
likewise conquered, and afterwards rendered tributary. No
tribute was in his time received from the Britons; but it
was paid to British emperors. He reigned thirteen years
and eight months. His monument is to be seen at Moguntia
(among the Lombards), where he died in his way to Rome.</p>

<p>&sect; 22. After the birth of Christ, one hundred and sixty-seven
years, king Lucius, with all the chiefs of the British
people, received baptism, in consequence of a legation sent
by the Roman emperors and pope Evaristus.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

<p>&sect; 23. Severus was the third emperor who passed the sea to
Britain, where, to protect the provinces recovered from
barbaric incursions, he ordered a wall and a rampart to be
made between the Britons, the Scots, and the Picts, extending
across the island from sea to sea, in length one hundred
and thirty-three<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> miles: and it is called in the British
language, Gwal.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> Moreover, he ordered it to be made be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>tween
the Britons, and the Picts and Scots; for the Scots
from the west, and the Picts from the north, unanimously
made war against the Britons; but were at peace among
themselves. Not long after Severus dies in Britain.</p>

<p>&sect; 24. The fourth was the emperor and tyrant, Carausius,
who, incensed at the murder of Severus, passed into Britain,
and attended by the leaders of the Roman people, severely
avenged upon the chiefs and rulers of the Britons, the cause
of Severus.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p>&sect; 25. The fifth was Constantius the father of Constantine
the Great. He died in Britain; his sepulchre, as it appears
by the inscription on his tomb, is still seen near the city
named Cair segont (near Carnarvon). Upon the pavement of
the above-mentioned city he sowed three seeds of gold, silver,
and brass, that no poor person might ever be found in it. It
is also called Minmanton.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></p>

<p>&sect; 26. Maximianus<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> was the sixth emperor that ruled in
Britain. It was in his time that consuls<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> began, and that
the appellation of C&aelig;sar was discontinued: at this period
also, St. Martin became celebrated for his virtues and miracles,
and held a conversation with him.</p>

<p>&sect; 27. The seventh emperor was Maximus. He withdrew
from Britain with all his military force, slew Gratian, the
king of the Romans, and obtained the sovereignty of all
Europe. Unwilling to send back his warlike companions to
their wives, children, and possessions in Britain, he conferred
upon them numerous districts from the lake on the summit
of Mons Jovis, to the city called Cant Guic, and to the
western Tumulus, that is, to Cruc Occident.<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> These are
the Armoric Britons, and they remain there to the present<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
day. In consequence of their absence, Britain being overcome
by foreign nations, the lawful heirs were cast out, till
God interposed with his assistance. We are informed by
the tradition of our ancestors that <i>seven</i> emperors went into
Britain, though the Romans affirm there were <i>nine</i>.</p>

<p>The eighth was another Severus, who lived occasionally
in Britain, and sometimes at Rome, where he died.</p>

<p>The ninth was Constantius who reigned sixteen years in
Britain, and, according to report, was treacherously murdered
in the seventeenth year of his reign.</p>

<p>&sect; 28. Thus, agreeably to the account given by the Britons,
the Romans governed them four hundred and nine years.</p>

<p>After this, the Britons despised the authority of the Romans,
equally refusing to pay them tribute, or to receive their kings;
nor durst the Romans any longer attempt the government
of a country, the natives of which massacred their deputies.</p>

<p>&sect; 29. We must now return to the tyrant Maximus. Gratian,
with his brother Valentinian, reigned seven years.
Ambrose, bishop of Milan, was then eminent for his skill in
the dogmata of the Catholics. Valentinianus and Theodosius
reigned eight years. At that time a synod was held at
Constantinople, attended by three hundred and fifty of the
fathers, and in which all heresies were condemned. Jerome,
the presbyter of Bethlehem, was then universally celebrated.
Whilst Gratian exercised supreme dominion over the world,
Maximus, in a sedition of the soldiers, was saluted emperor
in Britain, and soon after crossed the sea to Gaul. At Paris,
by the treachery of Mellobaudes, his master of the horse,
Gratian was defeated, and fleeing to Lyons, was taken and
put to death; Maximus afterwards associated his son Victor
in the government.</p>

<p>Martin, distinguished for his great virtues, was at this
period bishop of Tours. After a considerable space of time,
Maximus was divested of royal power by the consuls Valentinianus
and Theodosius, and sentenced to be beheaded at
the third milestone from Aquileia: in the same year also his
son Victor was killed in Gaul by Arbogastes, five thousand
six hundred and ninety years from the creation of the world.</p>

<p>&sect; 30. Thrice were the Roman deputies put to death by
the Britons, and yet these, when harassed by the incursions
of the barbarous nations, viz. of the Scots and Picts, earnestly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
solicited the aid of the Romans. To give effect to their entreaties,
ambassadors were sent, who made their entrance
with impressions of deep sorrow, having their heads covered
with dust, and carrying rich presents to expiate the murder
of the deputies. They were favourably received by the consuls,
and swore submission to the Roman yoke, with whatever
severity it might be imposed.</p>

<p>The Romans, therefore, came with a powerful army to the
assistance of the Britons; and having appointed over them
a ruler, and settled the government, returned to Rome: and
this took place alternately during the space of three hundred
and forty-eight years. The Britons, however, from the
oppression of the empire, again massacred the Roman deputies,
and again petitioned for succour. Once more the
Romans undertook the government of the Britons, and assisted
them in repelling their neighbours; and, after having exhausted
the country of its gold, silver, brass, honey, and
costly vestments, and having besides received rich gifts, they
returned in great triumph to Rome.</p>

<p>&sect; 31. After the above-said war between the Britons and
Romans, the assassination of their rulers, and the victory of
Maximus, who slew Gratian, and the termination of the
Roman power in Britain, they were in alarm forty years.</p>

<p>Vortigern then reigned in Britain. In his time, the
natives had cause of dread, not only from the inroads of the
Scots and Picts, but also from the Romans, and their apprehensions
of Ambrosius.<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></p>

<p>In the meantime, three vessels, exiled from Germany,
arrived in Britain. They were commanded by Horsa and
Hengist, brothers, and sons of Wihtgils. Wihtgils was the
son of Witta; Witta of Wecta; Wecta of Woden; Woden
of Frithowald; Frithowald of Frithuwulf; Frithuwulf of
Finn; Finn of Godwulf; Godwulf of Geat, who, as they
say, was the son of a god, not<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> of the omnipotent God and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
our Lord Jesus Christ (who before the beginning of the
world, was with the Father and the Holy Spirit, co-eternal
and of the same substance, and who, in compassion to human
nature, disdained not to assume the form of a servant), but
the offspring of one of their idols, and whom, blinded by
some demon, they worshipped according to the custom of the
heathen. Vortigern received them as friends, and delivered
up to them the island which is in their language called
Thanet, and, by the Britons, Ruym.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> Gratianus &AElig;quantius
at that time reigned in Rome. The Saxons were received
by Vortigern, four hundred and forty-seven years after the
passion of Christ, and,<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> according to the tradition of our
ancestors, from the period of their first arrival in Britain,
to the first year of the reign of king Edmund, five hundred
and forty-two years; and to that in which we now write,
which is the fifth of his reign, five hundred and forty-seven
years.</p>

<p>&sect; 32. At that time St. Germanus, distinguished for his
numerous virtues, came to preach in Britain: by his ministry
many were saved; but many likewise died unconverted. Of
the various miracles which God enabled him to perform, I
shall here mention only a few: I shall first advert to that
concerning an iniquitous and tyrannical king, named Benlli.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a>
The holy man, informed of his wicked conduct, hastened to
visit him, for the purpose of remonstrating with him. When
the man of God, with his attendants, arrived at the gate of
the city, they were respectfully received by the keeper of it,
who came out and saluted them. Him they commissioned to
communicate their intention to the king, who returned a
harsh answer, declaring, with an oath, that although they
remained there a year, they should not enter the city. While
waiting for an answer, the evening came on, and they knew
not where to go. At length, came one of the king's servants,
who bowing himself before the man of God, announced the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
words of the tyrant, inviting them, at the same time, to his
own house, to which they went, and were kindly received.
It happened, however, that he had no cattle, except one cow
and a calf, the latter of which, urged by generous hospitality
to his guests, he killed, dressed, and set before them. But
holy St. Germanus ordered his companions not to break a
bone of the calf; and, the next morning, it was found alive
uninjured, and standing by its mother.</p>

<p>&sect; 33. Early the same day, they again went to the gate of
the city, to solicit audience of the wicked king; and, whilst
engaged in fervent prayer they were waiting for admission, a
man, covered with sweat, came out, and prostrated himself
before them. Then St. Germanus, addressing him, said,
"Dost thou believe in the Holy Trinity?" To which the
man having replied, "I do believe," he baptized, and kissed
him, saying, "Go in peace; within this hour thou shalt die:
the angels of God are waiting for thee in the air; with them
thou shalt ascend to that God in whom thou hast believed."
He, overjoyed, entered the city, and being met by the prefect,
was seized, bound, and conducted before the tyrant, who
having passed sentence upon him, he was immediately put to
death; for it was a law of this wicked king, that whoever
was not at his labour before sun-rising should be beheaded in
the citadel. In the meantime, St. Germanus, with his attendants,
waited the whole day before the gate, without obtaining
admission to the tyrant.</p>

<p>&sect; 34. The man above-mentioned, however, remained with
them. "Take care," said St. Germanus to him, "that none
of your friends remain this night within these walls." Upon
this he hastily entered the city, brought out his nine sons,
and with them retired to the house where he had exercised
such generous hospitality. Here St. Germanus ordered them
to continue, fasting; and when the gates were shut, "Watch,"
said he, "and whatever shall happen in the citadel, turn not
thither your eyes; but pray without ceasing, and invoke the
protection of the true God." And, behold, early in the
night, fire fell from heaven, and burned the city, together with
all those who were with the tyrant, so that not one escaped;
and that citadel has never been rebuilt even to this day.</p>

<p>&sect; 35. The following day, the hospitable man who had
been converted by the preaching of St. Germanus, was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
baptized, with his sons, and all the inhabitants of that part
of the country; and St. Germanus blessed him, saying, "a
king shall not be wanting of thy seed for ever." The name
of this person is Catel Drunluc:<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> "from henceforward thou
shalt be a king all the days of thy life." Thus was fulfilled
the prophecy of the Psalmist: "He raiseth up the poor out
of the dust, and lifteth up the needy out of the dunghill."
And agreeably to the prediction of St. Germanus, from a
servant he became a king: all his sons were kings, and from
their offspring the whole country of Powys has been governed
to this day.</p>

<p>&sect; 36. After the Saxons had continued some time in the
island of Thanet, Vortigern promised to supply them with
clothing and provision, on condition they would engage to
fight against the enemies of his country. But the barbarians
having greatly increased in number, the Britons became
incapable of fulfilling their engagement; and when the
Saxons, according to the promise they had received, claimed
a supply of provisions and clothing, the Britons replied,
"Your number is increased; your assistance is now unnecessary;
you may, therefore, return home, for we can
no longer support you;" and hereupon they began to devise
means of breaking the peace between them.</p>

<p>&sect; 37. But Hengist, in whom united craft and penetration,
perceiving he had to act with an ignorant king, and a fluctuating
people, incapable of opposing much resistance, replied
to Vortigern, "We are, indeed, few in number; but, if you
will give us leave, we will send to our country for an
additional number of forces, with whom we will fight for you
and your subjects." Vortigern assenting to this proposal,
messengers were despatched to Scythia, where selecting a
number of warlike troops, they returned with sixteen vessels,
bringing with them the beautiful daughter of Hengist. And
now the Saxon chief prepared an entertainment, to which he
invited the king, his officers, and Ceretic, his interpreter,
having previously enjoined his daughter to serve them so
profusely with wine and ale, that they might soon become
intoxicated. This plan succeeded; and Vortigern, at the
instigation of the devil, and enamoured with the beauty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
of the damsel, demanded her, through the medium of his
interpreter, of the father, promising to give for her whatever
he should ask. Then Hengist, who had already consulted
with the elders who attended him of the Oghgul<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> race,
demanded for his daughter the province, called in English,
Centland, in British, Ceint, (Kent.) This cession was made
without the knowledge of the king, Guoyrancgonus,<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> who
then reigned in Kent, and who experienced no inconsiderable
share of grief, from seeing his kingdom thus clandestinely,
fraudulently, and imprudently resigned to foreigners. Thus
the maid was delivered up to the king, who slept with her,
and loved her exceedingly.</p>

<p>&sect; 38. Hengist, after this, said to Vortigern, "I will be to
you both a father and an adviser; despise not my counsels,
and you shall have no reason to fear being conquered by any
man or any nation whatever; for the people of my country
are strong, warlike, and robust: if you approve, I will send
for my son and his brother, both valiant men, who at my
invitation will fight against the Scots, and you can give them
the countries in the north, near the wall called <i>Gual</i>."<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> The
incautious sovereign having assented to this, Octa and Ebusa
arrived with forty ships. In these they sailed round the
country of the Picts, laid waste the Orkneys, and took
possession of many regions, even to the Pictish confines.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

<p>But Hengist continued, by degrees, sending for ships from
his own country, so that some islands whence they came were
left without inhabitants; and whilst his people were increasing
in power and number, they came to the above-named
province of Kent.</p>

<p>&sect; 39. In the meantime, Vortigern, as if desirous of adding
to the evils he had already occasioned, married his own
daughter, by whom he had a son. When this was made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
known to St. Germanus, he came, with all the British clergy,
to reprove him: and whilst a numerous assembly of the ecclesiastics
and laity were in consultation, the weak king ordered
his daughter to appear before them, and in the presence of
all to present her son to St. Germanus, and declare that he
was the father of the child. The immodest<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> woman obeyed;
and St. Germanus, taking the child, said, "I will be a father
to you, my son; nor will I dismiss you till a razor, scissors,
and comb, are given to me, and it is allowed you to
give them to your carnal father." The child obeyed St.
Germanus, and, going to his father Vortigern, said to him,
"Thou art my father; shave and cut the hair of my head."
The king blushed, and was silent; and, without replying to
the child, arose in great anger, and fled from the presence of
St. Germanus, execrated and condemned by the whole synod.</p>

<p>&sect; 40. But soon after, calling together his twelve wise
men, to consult what was to be done, they said to him, "Retire
to the remote boundaries of your kingdom; there build
and fortify a city<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> to defend yourself, for the people you have
received are treacherous; they are seeking to subdue you by
stratagem, and, even during your life, to seize upon all the
countries subject to your power, how much more will they
attempt, after your death!" The king, pleased with this
advice, departed with his wise men, and travelled through
many parts of his territories, in search of a place convenient
for the purpose of building a citadel. Having, to no purpose,
travelled far and wide, they came at length to a province
called Guenet;<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> and having surveyed the mountains of
Heremus,<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> they discovered, on the summit of one of them, a
situation, adapted to the construction of a citadel. Upon
this, the wise men said to the king, "Build here a city; for,
in this place, it will ever be secure against the barbarians."
Then the king sent for artificers, carpenters, stone-masons,
and collected all the materials requisite to building; but the
whole of these disappeared in one night, so that nothing re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>mained
of what had been provided for the constructing of
the citadel. Materials were, therefore, from all parts, procured
a second and third time, and again vanished as before,
leaving and rendering every effort ineffectual. Vortigern
inquired of his wise men the cause of this opposition to his
undertaking, and of so much useless expense of labour?
They replied, "You must find a child born without a father,
put him to death, and sprinkle with his blood the ground
on which the citadel is to be built, or you will never accomplish
your purpose."</p>

<p>&sect; 41. In consequence of this reply, the king sent messengers
throughout Britain, in search of a child born without a
father. After having inquired in all the provinces, they
came to the field of &AElig;lecti,<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> in the district of Glevesing,<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a>
where a party of boys were playing at ball. And two of
them quarrelling, one said to the other, "O boy without a
father, no good will ever happen to you." Upon this, the
messengers diligently inquired of the mother and the other
boys, whether he had had a father? Which his mother denied,
saying, "In what manner he was conceived I know
not, for I have never had intercourse with any man;" and
then she solemnly affirmed that he had no mortal father. The
boy was, therefore, led away, and conducted before Vortigern
the king.</p>

<p>&sect; 42. A meeting took place the next day for the purpose
of putting him to death. Then the boy said to the king,
"Why have your servants brought me hither?" "That you
may be put to death," replied the king, "and that the ground
on which my citadel is to stand, may be sprinkled with your
blood, without which I shall be unable to build it." "Who,"
said the boy, "instructed you to do this?" "My wise
men," answered the king. "Order them hither," returned
the boy; this being complied with, he thus questioned them:
"By what means was it revealed to you that this citadel
could not be built, unless the spot were previously sprinkled
with my blood? Speak without disguise, and declare who
discovered me to you;" then turning to the king, "I will
soon," said he, "unfold to you every thing; but I desire to
question your wise men, and wish them to disclose to you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
what is hidden under this pavement:" they acknowledging
their ignorance, "there is," said he, "a pool; come and dig:"
they did so, and found the pool. "Now," continued he,
"tell me what is in it;" but they were ashamed, and made
no reply. "I," said the boy, "can discover it to you: there
are two vases in the pool;" they examined, and found it so:
continuing his questions, "What is in the vases?" they were
silent: "there is a tent in them," said the boy; "separate
them, and you shall find it so;" this being done by the king's
command, there was found in them a folded tent. The boy,
going on with his questions, asked the wise men what was in
it? But they not knowing what to reply, "There are,"
said he, "two serpents, one white and the other red; unfold
the tent;" they obeyed, and two sleeping serpents were discovered;
"consider attentively," said the boy, "what they
are doing." The serpents began to struggle with each other;
and the white one, raising himself up, threw down the other
into the middle of the tent, and sometimes drove him to the
edge of it; and this was repeated thrice. At length the red
one, apparently the weaker of the two, recovering his
strength, expelled the white one from the tent; and the
latter being pursued through the pool by the red one, disappeared.
Then the boy, asking the wise men what was
signified by this wonderful omen, and they expressing their
ignorance, he said to the king, "I will now unfold to you
the meaning of this mystery. The pool is the emblem of
this world, and the tent that of your kingdom: the two serpents
are two dragons; the red serpent is your dragon, but
the white serpent is the dragon of the people who occupy
several provinces and districts of Britain, even almost from
sea to sea: at length, however, our people shall rise and
drive away the Saxon race from beyond the sea, whence
they originally came; but do you depart from this place, where
you are not permitted to erect a citadel; I, to whom fate has
allotted this mansion, shall remain here; whilst to you it is
incumbent to seek other provinces, where you may build a
fortress." "What is your name?" asked the king; "I am
called Ambrose (in British Embresguletic)," returned the
boy; and in answer to the king's question, "What is your
origin?" he replied, "A Roman consul was my father."</p>

<p>Then the king assigned him that city, with all the western<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
provinces of Britain; and departing with his wise men to
the sinistral district, he arrived in the region named Gueneri,
where he built a city which, according to his name, was called
Cair Guorthegirn.<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

<p>&sect; 43. At length Vortimer, the son of Vortigern, valiantly
fought against Hengist, Horsa, and his people; drove them
to the isle of Thanet, and thrice enclosed them within it, and
beset them on the western side.</p>

<p>The Saxons now despatched deputies to Germany to solicit
large reinforcements, and an additional number of ships:
having obtained these, they fought against the kings and
princes of Britain, and sometimes extended their boundaries
by victory, and sometimes were conquered and driven back.</p>

<p>&sect; 44. Four times did Vortimer valorously encounter the
enemy;<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> the first has been mentioned, the second was upon
the river Darent, the third at the Ford, in their language
called Epsford, though in ours Set thirgabail,<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> there Horsa
fell, and Catigern, the son of Vortigern; the fourth battle he
fought, was near the stone<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> on the shore of the Gallic sea,
where the Saxons being defeated, fled to their ships.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span></p><p>After a short interval Vortimer died; before his decease,
anxious for the future prosperity of his country, he charged
his friends to inter his body at the entrance of the Saxon
port, viz. upon the rock where the Saxons first landed; "for
though," said he, "they may inhabit other parts of Britain,
yet if you follow my commands, they will never remain in
this island." They imprudently disobeyed this last injunction,
and neglected to bury him where he had appointed.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<p>&sect; 45. After this the barbarians became firmly incorporated,
and were assisted by foreign pagans; for Vortigern
was their friend, on account of the daughter<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> of Hengist,
whom he so much loved, that no one durst fight against him&mdash;in
the meantime they soothed the imprudent king, and
whilst practising every appearance of fondness, were plotting
with his enemies. And let him that reads understand, that
the Saxons were victorious, and ruled Britain, not from
their superior prowess, but on account of the great sins of
the Britons: God so permitting it.</p>

<p>For what wise man will resist the wholesome counsel of
God? The Almighty is the King of kings, and the Lord of
lords, ruling and judging every one, according to his own
pleasure.</p>

<p>After the death of Vortimer, Hengist being strengthened
by new accessions, collected his ships, and calling his leaders
together, consulted by what stratagem they might overcome
Vortigern and his army; with insidious intention they sent
messengers to the king, with offers of peace and perpetual
friendship; unsuspicious of treachery, the monarch, after
advising with his elders, accepted the proposals.</p>

<p>&sect; 46. Hengist, under pretence of ratifying the treaty, prepared
an entertainment, to which he invited the king, the
nobles, and military officers, in number about three hundred;
speciously concealing his wicked intention, he ordered three
hundred Saxons to conceal each a knife under his feet, and
to mix with the Britons; "and when," said he, "they are
sufficiently inebriated, &amp;c. cry out, 'Nimed eure Saxes,' then
let each draw his knife, and kill his man; but spare the king,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
on account of his marriage with my daughter, for it is better
that he should be ransomed than killed."<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<p>The king with his company, appeared at the feast; and
mixing with the Saxons, who, whilst they spoke peace with
their tongues, cherished treachery in their hearts, each man
was placed next his enemy.</p>

<p>After they had eaten and drunk, and were much intoxicated,
Hengist suddenly vociferated, "Nimed eure Saxes!"
and instantly his adherents drew their knives, and rushing
upon the Britons, each slew him that sat next to him, and
there was slain three hundred of the nobles of Vortigern.
The king being a captive, purchased his redemption, by delivering
up the three provinces of East, South, and Middle
Sex, besides other districts at the option of his betrayers.</p>

<p>&sect; 47. St. Germanus admonished Vortigern to turn to the
true God, and abstain from all unlawful intercourse with his
daughter; but the unhappy wretch fled for refuge to the
province Guorthegirnaim,<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> so called from his own name,
where he concealed himself with his wives: but St. Germanus
followed him with all the British clergy, and upon a
rock prayed for his sins during forty days and forty nights.</p>

<p>The blessed man was unanimously chosen commander
against the Saxons. And then, not by the clang of trumpets,
but by praying, singing hallelujah, and by the cries of
the army to God, the enemies were routed, and driven even
to the sea.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p>

<p>Again Vortigern ignominiously flew from St. Germanus
to the kingdom of the Dimet&aelig;, where, on the river Towy,<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a>
he built a castle, which he named Cair Guothergirn. The
saint, as usual, followed him there, and with his clergy fasted
and prayed to the Lord three days, and as many nights. On
the third night, at the third hour, fire fell suddenly from
heaven, and totally burned the castle. Vortigern, the daughter
of Hengist, his other wives, and all the inhabitants, both men
and women, miserably perished: such was the end of this unhappy
king, as we find written in the life of St. Germanus.</p>

<p>&sect; 48. Others assure us, that being hated by all the people
of Britain, for having received the Saxons, and being pub<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>licly
charged by St. Germanus and the clergy in the sight of
God, he betook himself to flight; and, that deserted and a
wanderer, he sought a place of refuge, till broken hearted,
he made an ignominious end.</p>

<p>Some accounts state, that the earth opened and swallowed
him up, on the night his castle was burned; as no remains
were discovered the following morning, either of him, or of
those who were burned with him.</p>

<p>He had three sons: the eldest was Vortimer, who, as we
have seen, fought four times against the Saxons, and put them
to flight; the second Categirn, who was slain in the same
battle with Horsa; the third was Pascent, who reigned in
the two provinces Builth and Guorthegirnaim,<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> after the
death of his father. These were granted him by Ambrosius,
who was the great king among the kings of Britain. The
fourth was Faustus, born of an incestuous marriage with his
daughter, who was brought up and educated by St. Germanus.
He built a large monastery on the banks of the river
Renis, called after his name, and which remains to the present
period.<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

<p>&sect; 49. This is the genealogy of Vortigern, which goes back
to Fernvail,<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> who reigned in the kingdom of Guorthegirnaim,<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>
and was the son of Teudor; Teudor was the son of
Pascent; Pascent of Guoidcant; Guoidcant of Moriud;
Moriud of Eltat; Eltat of Eldoc; Eldoc of Paul; Paul of
Meuprit; Meuprit of Braciat; Braciat of Pascent; Pascent
of Guorthegirn; Guorthegirn of Guortheneu; Guortheneu of
Guitaul; Guitaul of Guitolion; Guitolion of Gloui. Bonus,
Paul, Mauron, Guotelin, were four brothers, who built Gloiuda,
a great city upon the banks of the river Severn, and in
British is called Cair Gloui, in Saxon, Gloucester. Enough
has been said of Vortigern.</p>

<p>&sect; 50. St. Germanus, after his death, returned into his own
country.
<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a>
At that time, the Saxons greatly increased in Britain,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
both in strength and numbers. And Octa, after the death
of his father Hengist, came from the sinistral part of the
island to the kingdom of Kent, and from him have proceeded
all the kings of that province, to the present period.</p>

<p>Then it was, that the magnanimous Arthur, with all the
kings and military force of Britain, fought against the
Saxons. And though there were many more noble than
himself, yet he was twelve times chosen their commander,
and was as often conqueror. The first battle in which he
was engaged, was at the mouth of the river Gleni.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> The
second, third, fourth, and fifth, were on another river, by the
Britons called Duglas,<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> in the region Linuis. The sixth,
on the river Bassas.<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> The seventh in the wood Celidon,
which the Britons call Cat Coit Celidon.<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> The eighth
was near Gurnion castle,<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> where Arthur bore the image of

through the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the holy
Mary, put the Saxons to flight, and pursued them the whole
day with great slaughter.<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> The ninth was at the City of
Legion,<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> which is called Cair Lion. The tenth was on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
banks of the river Trat Treuroit.<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> The eleventh was on the
mountain Breguoin, which we call Cat Bregion.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> The
twelfth was a most severe contest, when Arthur penetrated
to the hill of Badon.<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> In this engagement, nine hundred
and forty fell by his hand alone, no one but the Lord affording
him assistance. In all these engagements the Britons
were successful. For no strength can avail against the will
of the Almighty.</p>

<p>The more the Saxons were vanquished, the more they
sought for new supplies of Saxons from Germany; so that
kings, commanders, and military bands were invited over
from almost every province. And this practice they continued
till the reign of Ida, who was the son of Eoppa, he,
of the Saxon race, was the first king in Bernicia, and in
Cair Ebrauc (York).</p>

<p>When Gratian &AElig;quantius was consul at Rome, because
then the whole world was governed by the Roman consuls,
the Saxons were received by Vortigern in the year of our
Lord four hundred and forty-seven, and to the year in which
we now write, five hundred and forty-seven. And whosoever
shall read herein may receive instruction, the Lord Jesus
Christ affording assistance, who, co-eternal with the Father and
the Holy Ghost, lives and reigns for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>In those days Saint Patrick was a captive among the
Scots. His master's name was Milcho, to whom he was a
swineherd for seven years. When he had attained the age
of seventeen he gave him his liberty. By the divine
impulse, he applied himself to reading of the Scriptures,
and afterwards went to Rome; where, replenished with the
Holy Spirit, he continued a great while, studying the sacred
mysteries of those writings. During his continuance there,
Palladius, the first bishop, was sent by pope Celestine to
convert the Scots [the Irish]. But tempests and signs from
God prevented his landing, for no one can arrive in any
country, except it be allowed from above; altering therefore
his course from Ireland, he came to Britain and died in
the land of the Picts.<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span></p>
<p>&sect; 51. The death of Palladius being known, the Roman
patricians, Theodosius and Valentinian, then reigning, pope
Celestine sent Patrick to convert the Scots to the faith
of the Holy Trinity; Victor, the angel of God, accompanying,
admonishing, and assisting him, and also the bishop
Germanus.</p>

<p>Germanus then sent the ancient Segerus with him as a
venerable and praiseworthy bishop, to king Amatheus,<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> who
lived near, and who had prescience of what was to happen;
he was consecrated bishop in the reign of that king by the
holy pontiff,<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> assuming the name of Patrick, having hitherto
been known by that of Maun; Auxilius, Isserninus, and
other brothers were ordained with him to inferior degrees.</p>

<p>&sect; 52. Having distributed benedictions, and perfected all
in the name of the Holy Trinity, he embarked on the sea
which is between the Gauls and the Britons; and after a
quick passage arrived in Britain, where he preached for
some time. Every necessary preparation being made, and
the angel giving him warning, he came to the Irish Sea.
And having filled the ship with foreign gifts and spiritual
treasures, by the permission of God he arrived in Ireland,
where he baptized and preached.</p>

<p>&sect; 53. From the beginning of the world, to the fifth year
of king Logiore, when the Irish were baptized, and faith in
the unity of the individual Trinity was published to them,
are five thousand three hundred and thirty years.</p>

<p>&sect; 54. Saint Patrick taught the gospel in foreign nations
for the space of forty years. Endued with apostolical
powers, he gave sight to the blind, cleansed the lepers, gave
hearing to the deaf, cast out devils, raised nine from the
dead, redeemed many captives of both sexes at his own
charge, and set them free in the name of the Holy Trinity.
He taught the servants of God, and he wrote three hundred
and sixty-five canonical and other books relating to the
catholic faith. He founded as many churches, and conse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>crated
the same number of bishops, strengthening them with
the Holy Ghost. He ordained three thousand presbyters;
and converted and baptized twelve thousand persons in the
province of Connaught. And, in one day baptized seven
kings, who were the seven sons of Amalgaid.<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> He continued
fasting forty days and nights, on the summit of the
mountain Eli, that is Cruachan-Aichle;<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> and preferred three
petitions to God for the Irish, that had embraced the faith.
The Scots say, the first was, that he would receive every
repenting sinner, even at the latest extremity of life; the
second, that they should never be exterminated by barbarians;
and the third, that as Ireland<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> will be overflowed with
water, seven years before the coming of our Lord to judge
the quick and the dead, the crimes of the people might be
washed away through his intercession, and their souls
purified at the last day. He gave the people his benediction
from the upper part of the mountain, and going up higher,
that he might pray for them; and that if it pleased God, he
might see the effects of his labours, there appeared to him
an innumerable flock of birds of many colours, signifying
the number of holy persons of both sexes of the Irish
nation, who should come to him as their apostle at the day
of judgment, to be presented before the tribunal of Christ.
After a life spent in the active exertion of good to mankind,
St. Patrick, in a healthy old age, passed from this world to
the Lord, and changing this life for a better, with the saints
and elect of God he rejoices for evermore.</p>

<p>&sect; 55. Saint Patrick resembled Moses in four particulars.
The angel spoke to him in the burning bush. He fasted
forty days and forty nights upon the mountain. He attained
the period of one hundred and twenty years. No one knows
his sepulchre, nor where he was buried; sixteen<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> years he
was in captivity. In his twenty-fifth year, he was consecrated
bishop by Saint Matheus,<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> and he was eighty-five
years the apostle of the Irish. It might be profitable to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>

time to conclude this epitome of his labours.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a></p>

Edibrith, who begat Esa, who begat Eoppa, who begat Ida.
But Ida had twelve sons, Adda, Belric, Theodric, Ethelric,
Theodhere, Osmer, and one queen, Bearnoch, Ealric. Ethelric
begat Ethelfrid: the same is &AElig;dlfred Flesaur. For he
also had seven sons, Eanfrid, Oswald, Oswin, Oswy,
Oswudu, Oslac, Offa. Oswy begat Alfrid, Elfwin, and
Egfrid. Egfrid is he who made war against his cousin
Brudei, king of the Picts, and he fell therein with all the
strength of his army, and the Picts with their king gained
the victory; and the Saxons never again reduced the Picts
so as to exact tribute from them. Since the time of this
war it is called Gueithlin Garan.</p>

<p>But Oswy had two wives, Riemmelth, the daughter of
Royth, son of Rum; and Eanfled, the daughter of Edwin,
son of Alla.</p>

<h4>THE KINGS OF THE DEIRI.</h4>

<p>&sect; 61. Woden begat Beldeg, Brond begat Siggar, who

Soemil begat Sguerthing, who begat Giulglis, who begat
Ulfrea, who begat Iffi, who begat Ulli, Edwin, Osfrid, and
Eanfrid. There were two sons of Edwin, who fell with
him in battle at Meicen,<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> and the kingdom was never
renewed in his family, because not one of his race escaped
from that war; but all were slain with him by the army of
Catguollaunus,<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> king of the Guenedota. Oswy begat Egfrid,

who begat Adlsing, who begat Echun, who begat Oslaph.
Ida begat Eadric, who begat Ecgulf, who begat Leodwald,
who begat Eata, the same is Glinmaur, who begat Eadbert
and Egbert, who was the first bishop of their nation.</p>

<p>Ida, the son of Eoppa, possessed countries on the left-hand
side of Britain, <i>i.e.</i> of the Humbrian sea, and reigned twelve
years, and united<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> Dynguayth Guarth-Berneich.</p>

<p>&sect; 62. Then Dutigirn at that time fought bravely against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
the nation of the Angles. At that time, Talhaiarn Cataguen<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>
was famed for poetry, and Neirin, and Taliesin and Bluchbard,
and Cian, who is called Guenith Guaut, were all famous
at the same time in British poetry.</p>

<p>The great king, Mailcun,<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> reigned among the Britons, <i>i.e.</i>
in the district of Guenedota, because his great-great-grandfather,
Cunedda, with his twelve sons, had come before from
the left-hand part, <i>i.e.</i> from the country which is called
Manau Gustodin, one hundred and forty-six years before
Mailcun reigned, and expelled the Scots with much slaughter
from those countries, and they never returned again to
inhabit them.</p>

<p>&sect; 63. Adda, son of Ida, reigned eight years; Ethelric,
son of Adda, reigned four years. Theodoric, son of Ida,
reigned seven years. Freothwulf reigned six years. In
whose time the kingdom of Kent, by the mission of Gregory,
received baptism. Hussa reigned seven years. Against
him fought four kings, Urien, and Ryderthen, and Guallauc,
and Morcant. Theodoric fought bravely, together with
his sons, against that Urien. But at that time sometimes
the enemy and sometimes our countrymen were defeated,
and he shut them up three days and three nights in the
island of Metcaut; and whilst he was on an expedition he
was murdered, at the instance of Morcant, out of envy,
because he possessed so much superiority over all the kings
in military science. Eadfered Flesaurs reigned twelve years
in Bernicia, and twelve others in Deira, and gave to his wife
Bebba, the town of Dynguoaroy, which from her is called
Bebbanburg.<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></p>

<p>Edwin, son of Alla, reigned seventeen years, seized
on Elmete, and expelled Cerdic, its king. Eanfled, his
daughter, received baptism, on the twelfth day after
Pentecost, with all her followers, both men and women.
The following Easter Edwin himself received baptism, and
twelve thousand of his subjects with him. If any one wishes
to know who baptized them, it was Rum Map Urbgen:<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
was engaged forty days in baptizing all classes of the Saxons,
and by his preaching many believed on Christ.</p>

<p>&sect; 64. Oswald son of Ethelfrid, reigned nine years; the
same is Oswald Llauiguin;<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> he slew Catgublaun (Cadwalla),<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a>
king of Guenedot,<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> in the battle of Catscaul,<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> with much loss
to his own army. Oswy, son of Ethelfrid, reigned twenty-eight
years and six months. During his reign, there was a
dreadful mortality among his subjects, when Catgualart
(Cadwallader) was king among the Britons, succeeding his
father, and he himself died amongst the rest.<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> He slew
Penda in the field of Gai, and now took place the slaughter
of Gai Campi, and the kings of the Britons, who went out
with Penda on the expedition as far as the city of Judeu,
were slain.</p>

<p>&sect; 65. Then Oswy restored all the wealth, which was
with him in the city, to Penda; who distributed it among
the kings of the Britons, that is, Atbert Judeu. But
Catgabail alone, king of Guenedot, rising up in the night,
escaped, together with his army, wherefore he was called
Catgabail Catguommed. Egfrid, son of Oswy, reigned nine
years. In his time the holy bishop Cuthbert died in the
island of Medcaut.<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> It was he who made war against the
Picts, and was by them slain.</p>

<p>Penda, son of Pybba, reigned ten years; he first separated
the kingdom of Mercia from that of the North-men, and slew
by treachery Anna, king of the East Anglians, and St.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
Oswald, king of the North-men. He fought the battle of
Cocboy,<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> in which fell Eawa, son of Pybba, his brother, king
of the Mercians, and Oswald, king of the North-men, and
he gained the victory by diabolical agency. He was not
baptized, and never believed in God.</p>

<p>&sect; 66. From the beginning of the world to Constantinus
and Rufus, are found to be five thousand six hundred and
fifty-eight years.</p>

<p>Also from the two consuls, Rufus and Rubelius, to the
consul Stilicho, are three hundred and seventy-three years.</p>

<p>Also from Stilicho to Valentinian, son of Placida, and the
reign of Vortigern, are twenty-eight years.</p>

<p>And from the reign of Vortigern to the quarrel between
Guitolinus and Ambrosius, are twelve years, which is Guoloppum,
that is Catgwaloph.<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> Vortigern reigned in Britain
when Theodosius and Valentinian were consuls, and in the
fourth year of his reign the Saxons came to Britain, in the
consulship of Felix and Taurus, in the four hundredth year
from the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>From the year in which the Saxons came into Britain,
and were received by Vortigern, to the time of Decius and
Valerian, are sixty-nine years.</p>

of opinion exists among antiquaries respecting the site of Vortigern's
castle or city. Usher places it at <i>Gwent</i>, Monmouthshire, which name,
he says, was taken from Caer-Went, near Chepstow. This appears to agree
with Geoffrey's account, in page <a href="#Page_208">208</a> of this volume. See Usher's Britan.

Germanus, and falling down at his feet, he sued for pardon; and in atonement
for the calumny brought upon Germanus by his father and sister,
gave him the land, in which the forementioned bishop had endured such
abuse, to be his own for ever. Whence, in memory of St. Germanus, it

eight hundred miles in length.<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a></p>

<p>2. Britain was first called by the ancients Albion,<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
its <i>white</i> cliffs; and afterwards in the language of the natives,
Britain. Hence all the islands hereafter described
were denominated British.<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a></p>

<p>3. Britain is situated between the north and west,<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> opposite
to, though at some distance from, Germany, Gaul, and
Spain, the most considerable parts of Europe, and is bounded
by the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<p>4. On the south of Britain lies Belgic Gaul, from which
coast passengers usually sail to the Rhutupian port.<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> This
place is distant from Gessoriacum,<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> a town of the Morini,
the port most frequented by the Britons, fifty miles, or
according to others, four hundred and fifty stadia. From

in his Eclogues describes as separated from the whole
world,&mdash;</p>

the name Britain from the Ph&oelig;nician or Hebrew <i>Baratanac</i>, signifying the

<p>1. Albion, called by Chrysostom Great Britain, is, according
to C&aelig;sar, of a triangular shape, resembling Sicily. One
of the sides lies opposite to Celtic Gaul. One angle of this
side, which is the Cantian promontory,<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> is situated to the
east; the other, the Ocrinian promontory,<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> in the country
of the Damnonii, faces the south and the province of Tarraconensis
in Spain. This side is about five hundred miles in
length.</p>

<p>2. Another side stretches towards Ireland and the west,
the length of which, according to the opinion of the ancients,
is seven hundred miles.</p>

<p>3. The third side is situated to the north, and is opposite to
no land except a few islands;<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> but the angle of this side
chiefly trends towards Germania Magna.<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> The length from
the Novantian Chersonesus,<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> through the country of the
Taixali, to the Cantian promontory,<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> is estimated at eight
hundred miles. Thus all erroneously compute the circuit of
the island to be two thousand miles; for from the Cantian
promontory to Ocrinum,<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> the distance is four hundred miles;
from thence to Novantum, a thousand; and from thence to
the Cantian promontory, two thousand two hundred. The
circumference of the whole island is therefore three thousand
six hundred miles.<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a></p>

<p>4. Livy and Fabius Rusticus compare the form of Britain
to an oblong shield or battle-axe; and as, according to Tacitus,
it bears that figure on the side of Caledonia, the comparison
was extended to the whole island, though the bold promontories
at its further extremity give it the shape of a
wedge. But C&aelig;sar and Pomponius Mela assert that its form
is triangular.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span></p>

<p>5. If credit may be given to the celebrated geographer
Ptolemy and his contemporary writers, the island resembles
an inverted Z,<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> but according to the maps the comparison is
not exact. The triangular shape, however, seems to belong
to England alone.<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a></p>

<h3>CHAP. III.</h3>


<p>1. The original inhabitants of Britain, whether indigenous
or foreign, are, like those of most other countries, unknown.
The Jews alone, and by their means the contiguous nations,
have the happiness of tracing their descent since the creation
of the world from undoubted documents.</p>

<p>2. From the difference of personal appearance different
conjectures have been drawn. The red hair and large limbs
of the Caledonians proclaim their German origin; the
painted faces and curled locks of the Silures, and their
situation opposite to Spain, corroborate the assertion of
Tacitus, that the ancient Iberians passed over and occupied
this country and Ireland. Those who live nearest the Gauls
resemble them, either from the strength of the original stock,
or from the effects which the same positions of the heavens
produce on the human body.</p>

<p>3. If I were inclined to indulge a conjecture, I might
here mention that the Veneti<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> in their commercial expeditions
first introduced inhabitants and religion into this
country. Writers are not wanting, who assert that
Hercules came hither and established a sovereignty. But it
is needless to dwell on such remote antiquities and idle tales.<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span></p><p>4. On the whole, however, it is probable that the Gauls
occupied the contiguous regions. According to Tacitus,
their sacred rites and superstitions may be traced; nor is
the language very different; and lastly, the tradition of the
druids, with the names of the states which still retain the
same appellations as the people sprung from the cities of
Gaul, who came hither and began to cultivate the country.<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a></p>

<p>5. According to C&aelig;sar, the country was extremely populous,
and contained numerous buildings, not dissimilar to those of
the Gauls. It was rich in cattle.</p>

<p>6. The inhabitants of the southern part were the most
civilized, and in their customs differed little from the Gauls.
Those of the more distant parts did not raise corn; but lived
on fruits and flesh. They were ignorant of the use of wool
and garments, although in severe weather they covered
themselves with the skins of sheep or deer. They were
accustomed to bathe in the rivers.</p>

<p>7. All the Britons formerly stained their bodies of a blue
colour, which according to C&aelig;sar gave them a more terrible
appearance in battle. They wore their hair long, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
shaved all parts of the body except the head and the upper
lip.</p>

<p>8. Ten or twelve Britons had their wives in common;
and this custom particularly prevailed among brethren, and
between fathers and sons; but the children were considered
as belonging to him who had first taken the virgin to wife.
The mothers suckled their own children, and did not employ
maids and nurses.</p>

<p>9. According to C&aelig;sar also they used brass money, and
iron rings of a certain weight instead of coin.<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></p>

<p>10. The Britons deemed it unlawful to eat hares,<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> fowls,
or geese; but they kept those animals for pleasure.</p>

<p>11. They had pearls, bits made of ivory, bracelets, vessels
of amber and glass, agates, and, what surpasses all, great
abundance of tin.</p>

<p>12. They navigated in barks, the keels and ribs of which
were formed of light materials; the other parts were made
of wicker and covered with the hides of oxen.<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> During
their voyages, as Solinus asserts, they abstain from food.<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a></p>

<p>13. Britain produces people and kings of people, as
Pomponius Mela writes in his third book; but they are all
uncivilized, and in proportion as they are more distant from
the continent, are more ignorant of riches; their wealth
consisting chiefly in cattle and land. They are addicted to
litigation and war, and frequently attack each other, from a
desire of command, and of enlarging their possessions. It
is customary indeed for the Britons to wage war under the
guidance of women, and not to regard the difference of sex
in the distribution of power.</p>

<p>14. The Britons not only fought on foot and on horseback,
but in chariots drawn by two horses, and armed in the Gallic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
manner. Those chariots, to the axle-trees of which scythes
were fixed, were called <i>covini</i>, or wains.</p>

<p>15. C&aelig;sar relates that they employed cavalry in their
wars, which before the coming of the Romans were almost
perpetual. All were skilled in war; each in proportion to
his family and wealth supported a number of retainers, and
this was the only species of honour with which they were
acquainted.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></p>

<p>16. The principal strength of the Britons was in their
infantry, who fought with darts, large swords, and short
targets. According to Tacitus, their swords were blunt at
the point.</p>

<p>17. C&aelig;sar in his fourth book thus describes their mode of
fighting in that species of chariots called <i>essed&aelig;</i>.<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> At first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
they drove through the army in all directions, hurling their
darts; and by the terror of the horses, and the noise of the
wheels, generally threw the ranks of the enemy into disorder.
When they had penetrated between the troops of cavalry,
they leaped from their chariots and waged unequal war on
foot. Meanwhile the chariots were drawn up at a distance
from the battle, and placed in such a position, that if pressed
by the enemy, the warriors could effect a retreat to their
own army. They thus displayed the rapid evolutions of
cavalry, and the firmness of infantry, and were so expert by
exercise, as to hold up the horses in steep descents, to check
and turn them suddenly at full speed, to run along the pole,
stand on the yoke, and then spring into the chariot.</p>

<p>18. The mode of fighting on horseback threatened equal
danger to those who gave way, or those who pursued. They
never engaged in close lines, but in scattered bodies, and
with great intervals; they had their appointed stations, and
relieved each other by turns; and fresh combatants succeeded
those who were fatigued. The cavalry also used
darts.</p>

<p>19. It is not easy to determine the form of government
in Britain previous to the coming of the Romans. It is however
certain that before their times there was no vestige of a
monarchy, but rather of a democracy, unless perhaps it may
seem to have resembled an aristocracy.<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> The authority of
the Druids in affairs of the greatest moment was considerable.
Some chiefs are commemorated in their ancient records,
yet these appear to have possessed no permanent
power; but to have been created, like the Roman dictators,
in times of imminent danger. Nor are instances wanting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
among them, as among other brave nations, when they chose
even the leader of their adversaries to conduct their armies.
He, therefore, who before was their enemy, afterwards
fought on their side.</p>

<p>20. The Britons exceeded in stature both the Gauls and
the Romans. Strabo affirms that he saw at Rome some
British youths, who were considerably taller than the
Romans.</p>

<p>21. The more wealthy inhabitants of South Britain were
accustomed to ornament the middle finger of the left hand
with a gold ring; but a gold collar<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> round the neck was the
distinguishing mark of eminence. Those of the northern
regions, who were the indigenous inhabitants of the island
from time immemorial, were almost wholly ignorant of the
use of clothes, and surrounded their waists and necks, as
Herodian reports, with iron rings, which they considered as
ornaments and proofs of wealth. They carried a narrow
shield, fitter for use than ornament, and a lance, with a sword
pendant from their naked and painted bodies. They rejected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
or despised the breast-plate and helmet, because such armour
impeded their passage through the marshes.</p>

<p>22. Among other particulars, this custom prevailed in
Britain. They stopped travellers and merchants, and compelled
them to relate what they had heard, or knew, worthy
of notice. The common people usually surrounded foreign
merchants in the towns, and obliged them to tell from whence
they came, and what curious things they had observed. On
such vague reports they often rashly acted, and thus were
generally deceived; for many answered them agreeably to
their desires with fictitious stories.<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a></p>

<p>23. Their interments were magnificent; and all things
which they prized during life, even arms and animals, were
thrown into the funeral pile. A heap of earth and turf formed
the sepulchre.<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></p>

The historical Triads record that the first colonists of Britain were

land, or Tauric Chersonesus. There they have left many traces of their
name preserved by ancient authors, among which we may instance the
Cimmerian Bosphorus.

Subsequent colonists arrived from the neighbouring continent at various
times. The <i>Loegrwys</i> (Loegrians) from Gascogne; the <i>Brython</i> from
<i>Lydaw</i> (Britanny), who were descendants from the original stock of the
<i>Cymry</i>. Two descents are also mentioned in Albin, or North Britain; one
called the tribe of <i>Celyddon</i>, the other the primitive <i>Gwyddelians</i>.
Another descent is said to have been made in the south, in <i>Ynys-Wyth</i>,
or the Isle of Wight, by the men of <i>Galedin</i> (the Belg&aelig;), when their
native country was inundated. Another colony called the <i>Corani</i> came
from the country of the <i>Pwyl</i> (Poland), and settled on the sea coast, about
the river Humber. A descent in Albin, or North Britain, of a colony of
<i>Gwyddelian Ficti</i> [Irish Picts], who are described as coming from the sea
of <i>Loclyn</i> (the Baltic); and a partial settlement of the men of <i>Loclyn</i>
(Scandinavians), who were expelled after remaining for three generations.
The arrival of the Romans and Saxons is also mentioned, as well as
some partial settlements of Gwyddelians from Ireland.</p></div>

petty communities or states, headed by chiefs, who are here dignified with
the title of kings. From the jealousies and weakness attending such a
state of society, the island first became a prey to the Romans, and
afterwards to the Saxons; and when the Britons were confined to the
mountains of Wales, the same causes hastened the annexation of their
country to England.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_381_381" id="Footnote_381_381"></a><a href="#FNanchor_381_381"><span class="label">[381]</span></a> In the early ages chariots were universally used in war. In the
Scriptures they are frequently mentioned as forming the principal strength
of an army; and the mode of fighting in chariots among the Greeks and
Trojans, according to the description of Homer, was exactly similar to that
of the Britons. The steeds of his heroes were
</p>

<p style="margin-left:6em;"><br />
"Practised alike to stop, to turn, to chase,<br />
To dare the shock, or urge the rapid race."<br />
</p>

<p>
His warriors sometimes drive through the ranks of the enemy, sometimes
fight from their chariots, and sometimes alight and maintain the combat on
foot, while their chariots retire to the rear.

<p style="margin-left:6em;"><br />
"This counsel pleased, the godlike Hector sprung<br />
Swift from his seat; his clanging armour rung.<br />
The chief's example follow'd by his train,<br />
Each quits his car and issues on the plain;<br />
By orders strict the charioteers enjoin'd<br />
Compel the coursers to their ranks behind."<br />
</p>
<p>
The Britons, however, appear to have devised an improvement in this
mode of warfare, which was unknown to the Greeks. Their chariots seem
to have been of two kinds, the <i>covini</i> or wains, heavy and armed with
scythes, to break the thickest order of the enemy; and the <i>essed&aelig;</i>, a
lighter kind, adapted probably to situations and circumstances in which
the <i>covini</i> could not act, and occasionally performing the duties of cavalry.
The <i>essed&aelig;</i>, with the cavalry, were pushed forward to oppose the first
landing of C&aelig;sar; and Cassivellaunus afterwards left 4000 <i>essed&aelig;</i> as a corps of observation to watch his movements.&mdash;<i>C&aelig;sar. Comment. lib.</i>

Each community was governed by its elders; and every individual
who could not prove his kindred to some community, through nine
descents, and the same number of collateral affinities, was not considered
as a freeman. Beyond this degree of kindred, they were formed into new
communities. The elders of the different communities were subordinate to
the elders of the tribes. But in times of public danger, as is recorded in
the Triads, some chief of distinguished abilities was entrusted with the
supreme authority over the tribes or communities, who united in common
defence&mdash;Such were Caswallon (Cassivellaunus), Caradwg (Caractacus),

of the British bards afford little assistance in supplying this deficiency. It
appears, however, that the Britons raised tumuli over their dead, and
continued the practice till after the introduction of Christianity; and
that their other modes of interment were the <i>carned</i>, or heap of stones;
the <i>cistvaen</i>, or stone chest; and perhaps the <i>cromlec</i>, or hanging
stone. From a curious fragment commemorating the graves of the
British warriors, which is printed in the first volume of the Welch Arch&aelig;ology,
we learn further, that they buried their dead on the top of hills and
lofty cliffs, on declivities, in heaths and secluded valleys, on the banks and
near the fords of rivers, and on the sea-shore "where the ninth wave
breaks." Allusions are also made to corresponding stones raised on these
graves; and it is said, "the <i>long</i> graves in Gwanas, no one knows to whom
they belong nor what is their history."
</p><p>
As the modes of interment among all early nations were in many respects
similar, there is perhaps no part of our national antiquities which has
given scope to so much conjecture as this. The reader who is desirous of
more particular information relative to this subject, may at least find
amusement in consulting the works of Stukeley, Douglas's <i>Nenia Britannica</i>,
the <i>Arch&aelig;ologia</i>, and various accounts scattered in different periodical

<h3>CHAP. IV.</h3>


<p>1. All the Britons, like the Gauls, were much addicted
to superstitious ceremonies; and those who laboured under
severe disorders, or were exposed to the dangers of war,
either offered human victims, or made a vow to perform
such a sacrifice.</p>

<p>2. The druids were employed in the performance of these
cruel rites; and they believed that the gods could not be
appeased unless the life of a man was ransomed with human
blood. Hence arose the public institution of such sacrifices;
and those who had been surprised in theft, robbery, or any
other delinquency, were considered as the most acceptable
victims. But when criminals could not be obtained, even
the innocent were put to death, that the gods might be
appeased.</p>

<p>3. The sacred ceremonies could not be performed except
in the presence of the druids; and on them devolved the
office of providing for the public as well as private rites.
They were the guardians of religion and the interpreters
of mysteries; and being skilled in medicine, were consulted
for the preservation or restoration of health.</p>

<p>4. Among their gods, the principal object of their worship
was Mercury.<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> Next to him they adored justice (under the
name of Astarte), then Apollo, and Mars (who was called
Vitucadrus), Jupiter, Minerva, Hercules, Victory (called
Andate), Diana, Cybele, and Pluto. Of these deities they
held the same opinions as other nations.</p>

<p>5. The Britons, like the Gauls, endeavoured to derive
their origin from Dis or Pluto, boasting of this ancient
tradition of the druids. For this reason they divided time,
not by the number of days, but of nights, and thus distin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>guished
the commencement of the month, and the time of
their birth. This custom agrees with the ancient mode
of computation adopted in Genesis, chapter i.<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></p>

<p>6. The druids, being held in high veneration, were greatly
followed by the young men for the sake of their instructions.
They decided almost all public and private controversies, and
determined disputes relative to inheritance or the boundaries
of lands. They decreed rewards and punishments, and
enforced their decisions by an exclusion from the sacrifices.
This exclusion was deemed the severest punishment; because
the interdicted, being deemed impious and wicked, were
shunned as if contagious; justice was refused to their
supplications, and they were allowed no marks of honour.<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a></p>

<p>7. Over the druids presided a chief, vested with supreme
authority. At his death he was succeeded by the next in
dignity; but if there were several of equal rank, the contest
was decided by the suffrages of their body; and sometimes
they even contended in arms for this honour.<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a></p>

<p>8. The druids went not to war, paid no tribute like the
rest of the people, were exempted from military duties, and
enjoyed immunities in all things. From these high privileges
many either voluntarily entered into their order, or were
placed in it by friends or parents.</p>

<p>9. They learned a number of verses, which were the only
kind of memorials or annals in use among them.<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> Some
persons accordingly remained twenty years under their
instruction, which they did not deem it lawful to commit
to writing, though on other subjects they employed the
Greek alphabet. "This custom," to use the words of Julius
C&aelig;sar, "seems to have been adopted for two reasons: first,
not to expose their doctrines to the common people; and,
secondly, lest their scholars, trusting to letters, should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
be less anxious to remember their precepts; for such
assistance commonly diminishes application, and weakens
the memory."</p>

<p>10. In the first place they circulated the doctrine that
souls do not die, but migrate into other bodies.<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> By this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
principle they hoped men would be more powerfully actuated
to virtue, and delivered from the fear of death. They
likewise instructed students in the knowledge of the heavenly
bodies, in geography, the nature of things, and the power
of the gods.<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a></p>

<p>11. Their admiration of the mistletoe must not be omitted.
The druids esteemed nothing more sacred than the mistletoe,
and the tree on which it grew, if an oak. They particularly
delighted in groves of oaks,<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> and performed no sacred rite
without branches of that tree, and hence seems to be
derived their name of druids, &#916;&#961;&#965;&#953;&#948;&#949;&#962;. Whatever grew on
an oak was considered as sent from heaven, and as a sign
that the tree was chosen by God himself. The mistletoe was
difficult to be found, and when discovered was gathered with
religious ceremonies, particularly at the sixth day of the
moon (from which period they dated their months and years,
and their cycle of thirty years,) because the moon was
supposed to possess extraordinary powers when she had not
completed her second quarter. The mistletoe was called in
their language <i>all heal</i>.<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> The sacrifice and the feast being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
duly prepared under the tree, they led thither two white
bulls, whose horns were then bound for the first time.<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> The
priest, clothed in a white vestment, ascending the tree, cut
off the mistletoe with a golden bill, and received it in a white
cloth. They then slew the victims, invoking the favour of
the Deity on their offering. They conceived that the mistletoe
cured sterility in animals; and considered it as a specific
against all poisons. So great was the superstition generally
prevailing among nations with respect to frivolous objects.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span></p><p>13. At a certain time of the year the druids retired to a
consecrated grove in the island of Mona, whither all persons
among whom controversies had arisen, repaired for the decision
of their disputes.</p>

<p>14. Besides the druids, there were among the Gauls and
Britons poets, called bards,<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> who sang in heroic measures the
deeds of the gods and heroes, accompanied with the sweet
notes of the lyre.</p>

<p>15. Concerning the druids and bards, I shall conclude
this chapter in the words of Lucan:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left:6em;">
"You too, ye bards! whom sacred raptures fire.<br />
To chant your heroes to your country's lyre;<br />
Who consecrate, in your immortal strain,<br />
Brave patriot souls, in righteous battle slain,<br />
Securely now the tuneful task renew,<br />
And noblest themes in deathless songs pursue.<br />
The druids now, while arms are heard no more,<br />
Old mysteries and barbarous rites restore,<br />
A tribe who singular religion love,<br />
And haunt the lonely coverts of the grove.<br />
To these, and these of all mankind alone,<br />
The gods are sure revealed or sure unknown.<br />
If dying mortals' doom they sing aright,<br />
No ghosts descend to dwell in dreadful night;<br />
No parting souls to grisly Pluto go,<br />
Nor seek the dreary silent shades below;<br />
But forth they fly immortal in their kind,<br />
And other bodies in new worlds they find;<br />
Thus life for ever runs its endless race,<br />
And like a line death but divides the space,<br />
A stop which can but for a moment last,<br />
A point between the future and the past.<br />
Thrice happy they beneath their northern skies,<br />
Who that worst fear&mdash;the fear of death&mdash;despise<br />
Hence they no cares for this frail being feel,<br />
But rush undaunted on the pointed steel;<br />
Provoke approaching fate, and bravely scorn<br />
To spare that life which must so soon return."<br />

against the grand principle of the druidic theology, and because, as they
assert, no traces of the Greek or Roman deities are found among the early
Britons. Possibly some of the British tribes might have brought this mode
of worship from Gaul; but more probably the assertion was derived from
the misconception of the ancient authors themselves, who gave the names
of their own deities to the objects of adoration distinguished by similar
attributes in other countries. The account is borrowed from C&aelig;sar's
description of the Gauls, lib. vi. &sect; 15.</p></div>

druidical knowledge forms the basis of the Triads. If this be the case, it
must be confessed that the bards possessed a profound knowledge of human
nature, uncommon critical sagacity, and a perfect acquaintance with the harmony of language and the properties of metre. For example, the
subjects of the poetical Triads are,
</p>

<p style="margin-left:6em;">
The Welsh language.<br />
Fancy and invention.<br />
The design of poetry.<br />
Nature of just thinking.<br />

Variety of matter and invention.<br />

verse, rhyme, stanzas, consonancy or alliteration,<br />
and accent.<br />

<p>We quote a few of these Triads to show their nature and structure.</p>

<p>The three foundations of judgment;&mdash;bold design, frequent practice,

<p>The three canons of perspicuity;&mdash;the word that is necessary, the
quantity that is necessary, and the manner that is necessary.</p>

<p>The three canons of amplitude;&mdash;appropriate thought, variety of thought,
and requisite thought.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_391_391" id="Footnote_391_391"></a><a href="#FNanchor_391_391"><span class="label">[391]</span></a> According to the Triads, the theology of the bards was pure monotheism.
They taught also the transmigration of souls; believing that the soul passed
by death through all the gradations of animal life, from Anoom, the bottomless
abyss, or lowest degree of animation, up to the highest degree of
spiritual existence next to the Supreme Being. Human nature was considered
as the middle point of this scale. As this was a state of liberty,
in which the soul could attach itself to either good or evil; if evil predominated,
it was after death obliged to retrace its former transmigrations from
a point in the animal creation equal to its turpitude, and it again and again
became man till it was attached to good. Above humanity, though it
might again animate the body of man, it was incapable of relapse; but
continued progressively rising to a degree of goodness and happiness, inferior
only to the Deity.
</p><p>
It is remarkable that many singular points of coincidence have been
discovered in comparing the religious system of the Hindoos with that
of the ancient Britons; and in the languages of these two people some
striking similarities occur in those proverbs and forms of expression which
are derived from national customs and religious ceremonies.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_394_394" id="Footnote_394_394"></a><a href="#FNanchor_394_394"><span class="label">[394]</span></a> The worship and religious ceremonies of the druids have formed the
subject of many and voluminous dissertations; and the mistletoe, from its
connection with their sacred rites, is a plant that has always been interesting
to antiquaries. In a letter recently received by the editor from the
learned and scientific Professor of Botany, Dr. Daubeny, of Magdalen
College, Oxford, that gentleman observes, that though the mistletoe is
occasionally found on the oak in Britain, yet this occurs so rarely that it is
difficult to suppose the druids could have got a supply for their purposes
from such a source.
</p><p>
"There is a plant nearly allied to the mistletoe, the Loranthus Europ&aelig;us,
which grows freely on the oak, when it occurs; but unfortunately the
most western locality known is the garden of Schoenbrunn near Vienna,
but out of the limits, I believe, within which the druidical worship existed:
it is very uncommon in Hungary.
</p><p>
"This circumstance has given rise to an hypothesis, which I may repeat
without attaching to it any very great importance, namely, that the Loranthus
is the mistletoe of the druids, and that when the druidical worship
was exterminated, this plant, as being introduced into their rites, was extirpated
from all those parts of Europe, where the druids were known."
</p><p>
The oak among the ancient Britons was peculiarly sacred as the place of
worship, and consequently branches of this tree were used to adorn the
altar, and garlands of its leaves to decorate the priest or druid; and the mistletoe, being so seldom found on the oak, was considered so great and
desirable an appendage, that no solemn festival was held without it.
It has been observed by naturalists that the blossom of the mistletoe falls
within a few days of the summer solstice, and the berry within a few days
of the winter solstice. These incidents therefore marked the return of two
of the usual seasons for holding the bardic conventions and festivals. When
the sacrifice was over, the berries of this plant were taken by the ovate, the
physician of the tribe, and converted to medical purposes. That these
berries possessed medicinal virtues can hardly be doubted. The following
passage respecting this sacred plant occurs in Bacon:&mdash;"Mistletoe groweth
chiefly upon crab trees, apple trees, sometimes upon hazels, and rarely upon
oaks; the mistletoe whereof is counted very medicinal. It is ever green,
winter and summer, and beareth a white glistening berry: and it is a plant
utterly differing from the plant on which it groweth."
</p><p>
Sir John Colbach published a Dissertation on the efficacy of the
mistletoe in 1720; but in medicine, as in fashion, what is deemed of high
value in one age is discontinued in the next, and thought nothing of. Such
is the fate of the mistletoe in the present day as to any medicinal use that
is made of it.</p></div>

The doctrine of the druids is said to have been first invented
in Britain, and from thence carried into Gaul; on
which account Pliny says (in his thirtieth book), "But why
should I commemorate these things with regard to an art
which has passed over the sea, and reached the bounds of
nature? Britain even at this time celebrates it with so
many wonderful ceremonies, that she seems to have taught
it to the Persians." Julius C&aelig;sar affirms the same in his
Commentaries: "And now those persons who wish to acquire
a more extensive knowledge of such things, repair to Britain
for information."
</p>

<p>
It is a singular coincidence of circumstances that bulls perfectly white
were sacrificed by the Egyptians to Apis. When such an animal was
found unblemished, and without a single black hair, the priest tied a fillet
about his horns, and sealed it with the signet of his ring; it being a capital
crime to sacrifice one of these animals except it was thus marked.&mdash;<i>Herodotus.</i></p></div>

The druidical, or rather bardic, system consisted of three classes: the bard
proper, whose province was philosophy and poetry; the druid, or minister
of religion; and the ovate, or mechanic and artist. For a curious account
of the bardic system and institutions the reader is referred to the Introduction
to Owen's Translations of the Elegies of Llywarch H&ecirc;n.</p></div>

<p>1. This island is rich in corn and wood, is well adapted
for the maintenance of flocks and cattle, and in some places
produces vines. It also abounds with marine and land
birds, and contains copious springs, and numerous rivers,
stored with fish, and plentifully supplied with salmon and
eels.</p>

<p>2. Sea-cows or seals,<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> and dolphins are caught, and whales,
of which mention is made by the satirist:</p>

<p class="center">
"Quanto delphinis bal&aelig;na Britannica major."<br />
</p>

<p>3. There are besides several sorts of shell-fish, among
which are muscles, containing pearls often of the best kind,
and of every colour: that is, red, purple, violet, green (<i>prasini</i>),
but principally white, as we find in the venerable
Bede's Ecclesiastical History.</p>

<p>4. Shells<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> are still more abundant, from which is prepared
a scarlet dye of the most beautiful hue, which never fades
from the effect of the sun or rain, but becomes finer as it
grows older.</p>

<p>5. In Britain are salt and warm springs, from which are
formed hot baths, suited to all ages, with distinct places for
the two sexes.<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a></p>

<p>6. White lead is found in the midland regions, and iron in
the maritime, but in small quantities gold and silver are also
produced, but brass is imported. Jet of the purest quality
abounds; it is of a shining black, and highly inflammable.<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a>

<p>7. Britain being situated almost under the north pole, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
nights are so light in summer, that it is often doubtful whether
the evening or morning twilight prevails; because the
sun, in returning to the east, does not long remain below the
horizon. Hence, also, according to Cleomenes, the longest
day in summer, and the longest night in winter, when the
sun declines towards the south, is eighteen hours; and the
shortest night in summer, and day in winter, is six hours.
In the same manner as in Armenia, Macedon, Italy, and the
regions under the same parallel, the longest day is fifteen,
and the shortest nine hours.</p>

<p>8. But I have given a sufficient account of Britain and the
Britons in general. I shall now descend to particulars; and
in the succeeding pages, shall describe the state and revolutions
of the different nations who inhabited this island, the
cities which ennobled it, with other particulars, and their
condition under the Roman dominion.</p>

<h3>CHAP. VI.</h3>


<p>1. Britain, according to the most accurate and authentic
accounts of the ancients, was divided into seven parts,
six of which were at different times subjected to the Roman
empire, and the seventh held by the uncivilized Caledonians.</p>

<p>2. These divisions were called Britannia Prima, Secunda,
Flavia, Maxima, Valentia, and Vespasiana, which last did
not long remain under the power of the Romans. Britannia
Prima is separated by the river Thamesis from Flavia, and
by the sea<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> from Britannia Secunda. Flavia begins from the
German Ocean, is bounded by the Thamesis,<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> by the Sabrina,<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a>
on the side of the Silures and Ordovices, and trends
towards the north and the region of the Brigantes.<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> Maxima,
beginning at the extreme boundary of Flavia, reaches
to the wall,<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> which traverses the whole island, and faces the
north. Valentia occupies the whole space between this wall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
and that built by the emperor Antoninus Pius, from the
estuary of the Bdora<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> to that of the Clydda.<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> Vespasiana
stretches from the estuary of the Bdora to the city of Alcluith,<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a>
from whence a line drawn to the mouth of the Varar<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a>
shows the boundary. Britannia Secunda faces the Irish Sea
to the north and west. But sufficient notice has now been
taken of the provinces.</p>

<p>3. Before we proceed to a more minute description, let us
touch upon the form of government. In remote times all
Britain was divided among petty princes and states, some of
whom are said to have existed after the country was occupied
by the Romans; though, under the Roman domination, they
retained scarcely the shadow of regal authority. A legate
being appointed by the emperor over the conquered countries,
Britain became a proconsular province. This form of government
continued several ages, although in the meantime
the island underwent many divisions, first into the Upper
and Lower districts, and then, as we have before shown, into
seven parts. It afterwards became the imperial residence of
Carausius and those whom he admitted to a share of his
power. Constantine the Great, the glory and defence of
Christianity, is supposed to have raised Maxima and Valentia
to consular provinces, and Prima, Secunda, and Flavia, to
pr&aelig;sidials. But over the whole island was appointed a
deputy-governor, under the authority of the pr&aelig;torian prefect
of Gaul. Besides whom, an ancient volume, written
about that period, mentions a person of great dignity, by
the title of <i>comes</i>, or count of the Britons, another as count
of the Saxon coast, and a third as leader or duke of Britain;
with many others, who, although possessed of great offices,
must be passed over in silence, for want of certain information.<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a></p>

<p>4. I now commence my long journey, to examine minutely
the whole island and its particular parts, and shall follow the
footsteps of the best authors. I begin with the extreme part
of the first province, whose coasts are opposite Gaul. This
province contains three celebrated and powerful states,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
namely, Cantium, Belgium, and Damnonium, each of which
in particular I shall carefully examine.</p>

<p>First of Cantium.</p>

<p>5. Cantium,<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> situated at the extremity of Britannia Prima,
was inhabited by the Cantii, and contains the cities of Durobrobis<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a>
and Cantiopolis,<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> which was the metropolis, and the
burial-place of St. Augustine, the apostle of the English;
Dubr&aelig;,<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> Lemanus,<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> and Regulbium<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> garrisoned by the
Romans; also their primary station Rhutupis,<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> which was
colonized and became the metropolis, and where a haven was
formed capable of containing the Roman fleet which commanded
the North Sea. This city was of such celebrity that
it gave the name of Rhutupine to the neighbouring shores;
which Lucan,</p>

<p class="center">
"Aut vaga quum Thetis Rhutupinaque littora fervent."<br />
</p>

<p>From hence oysters of a large size and superior flavour were
sent to Rome, as Juvenal observes,</p>

<p style="margin-left:6em;">
<span style="margin-left: 13em;">"Circ&aelig;is nata forent, an</span><br />
Lucrinum ad saxum, <span class="smcap">Rhutupinove</span> edita fundo<br />
Ostrea, callebat primo deprendere morsu."<br />
</p>

<p>It was the station of the second Augustan legion, under the
count of the Saxon coast, a person of high distinction.</p>

<p>6. The kingdom of Cantium is watered by many rivers.
The principal are Madus<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a>, Sturius,<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> Dubris,<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> and Lemanus,<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a>
which last separates the Cantii from the Bibroci.</p>

<p>7. Among the three principal promontories of Britain, that
which derives its name from Cantium<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> is most distinguished.
There the ocean, being confined in an angle, according to the
tradition of the ancients, gradually forced its way, and
formed the strait which renders Britain an island.</p>

<p>8. The vast forest called by some the Anderidan, and by
others the Caledonian, stretches from Cantium a hundred
and fifty miles, through the countries of the Bibroci and the
Segontiaci, to the confines of the Hedui. It is thus mentioned
by the poet Lucan:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
"Unde Caledoniis fallit turbata Britannos."<br />
</p>

<p>9. The Bibroci<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> were situated next to the Cantii, and, as
some imagine, were subject to them. They were also called
Rhemi, and are not unknown in record. They inhabited
Bibrocum,<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> Regentium,<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> and Noviomagus,<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> which was their
metropolis. The Romans held Anderida.<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a></p>

<p>10. On their confines, and bordering on the Thames,
dwelt the Atrebates,<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> whose primary city was Calleba.<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a></p>

<p>11. Below them, nearer the river Kunetius,<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> lived the
Segontiaci,<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> whose chief city was Vindonum.<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a></p>

<p>12. Below, towards the ocean, and bordering on the Bibroci,
lived the Belg&aelig;,<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> whose chief cities were Clausentum,<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a>
now called Southampton; Portus Magnus;<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> Venta,<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> a noble
city situated upon the river Antona. Sorbiodunum<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> was
garrisoned by the Romans. All the Belg&aelig; are Allobroges,
or foreigners, and derived their origin from the Belg&aelig; and
Celts. The latter, not many ages before the arrival of
C&aelig;sar, quitted their native country, Gaul, which was conquered
by the Romans and Germans, and passed over to this
island: the former, after crossing the Rhine, and occupying
the conquered country, likewise sent out colonies, of which
C&aelig;sar has spoken more at large.<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a></p>

<p>13. All the regions south of the Thamesis<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> were, according
to ancient records, occupied by the warlike nations of the
Senones. These people, under the guidance of their renowned
king Brennus, penetrated through Gaul, forced a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
passage over the Alps, hitherto deemed impracticable, and
would have razed proud Rome, had not the fates, which
seemed like to carry the republic in their bosom, till it reached
its destined height of glory, averted the threatened calamity.
By the cackle of a goose Manlius was warned of the danger,
and hurled the barbarians from the capitol, in their midnight
attack. The same protecting influence afterwards sent
Camillus to his assistance, who, by assailing them in the rear,
quenched the conflagration which they had kindled, in
Senonic blood, and preserved the city from impending destruction.
In consequence of this vast expedition, the land
of the Senones,<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> being left without inhabitants, and full of
spoils, was occupied by the above-mentioned Belg&aelig;.</p>

<p>14. Near the Sabrina and below the Thamesis lived the
Hedui,<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> whose principal cities were Ischalis<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> and Avalonia.<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a>
The baths,<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> which were also called Aqu&aelig; Solis, were made
the seat of a colony, and became the perpetual residence of
the Romans who possessed this part of Britain. This was a
celebrated city, situated upon the river Abona, remarkable
for its hot springs, which were formed into baths at a great
expense. Apollo and Minerva<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> were the tutelary deities, in
whose temples the perpetual fire never fell into ashes, but as
it wasted away turned into globes of stone.</p>

<p>15. Below the Hedui are situated the Durotriges, who are
sometimes called Morini. Their metropolis was Durinum,<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a>
and their territory extended to the promontory Vindelia.<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a>
In their country the land is gradually contracted, and seems
to form an immense arm which repels the waves of the
ocean.</p>

<p>16. In this arm was the region of the Cimbri,<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> whose
country was divided from that of the Hedui by the river
Uxella.<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> It is not ascertained whether the Cimbri gave to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
Wales its modern name, or whether their origin is more
remote. Their chief cities were Termolus<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> and Artavia.<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a>
From hence, according to the ancients, are seen the pillars of
Hercules, and the island Herculea<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> not far distant. From
the Uxella a chain of mountains called Ocrinum extends to
the promontory known by the same name.</p>

<p>17. Beyond the Cimbri the Carnabii inhabited the
extreme angle of the island,<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> from whom this district probably
obtained its present name of Carnubia (Cornwall).
Their chief cities were Musidum<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> and Halangium.<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> But as
the Romans never frequented these almost desert and
uncultivated parts of Britain, their cities seem to have been
of little consequence, and were therefore neglected by
historians; though geographers mention the promontories
Bolerium and Antivest&aelig;um.<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a></p>

<p>18. Near the above-mentioned people on the sea-coast
towards the south, and bordering on the Belg&aelig; Allobroges,
lived the Damnonii, the most powerful people of those parts;
on which account Ptolemy assigns to them all the country
extending into the sea like an arm.<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> Their cities were
Uxella,<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> Tamara,<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> Voluba,<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> Cenia,<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> and Isca,<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> the mother of
all, situated upon the Isca. Their chief rivers were the Isca,<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a>
Durius,<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> Tamarus,<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> and Cenius.<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> Their coasts are distinguished
by three promontories, which will be hereafter
mentioned. This region was much frequented by the Ph&oelig;nician,
Grecian, and Gallic merchants, for the metals with
which it abounded, particularly for its tin. Proofs of this
may be drawn from the names of the above-mentioned
promontories, namely Hellenis,<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> Ocrinum,<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> and &#922;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#965; &#956;&#949;&#964;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#957;<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a>
as well as the numerous appellations of cities, which show a
Grecian or Ph&oelig;nician derivation.</p>

<p>19. Beyond this arm are the isles called Sygdiles,<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> which
are also denominated &#338;stromenides and Cassiterides.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span></p>
<p>20. It is affirmed that the emperor Vespasian fought
thirty battles with the united forces of the Damnonii and
Belg&aelig;. The ten different tribes who inhabited the south
banks of the Thames and Severn being gradually subdued,
their country was formed into the province of Britannia
Prima, so called because it was the first fruit of victory
obtained by the Romans.</p>

<p>21. Next in order is Britannia Secunda, which is divided
from Britannia Prima by the countries already mentioned,
and from the Flavian province by the Sabrina<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> and the
Deva;<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> and the remaining parts are bounded by the internal
sea. This was the renowned region of the Silures,<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> inhabited
by three powerful tribes. Among these were
particularly distinguished the Silures Proper, whom the
turbid estuary of the Severn divides from the country we
have just described. These people, according to Solinus,
still retain their ancient manners, have neither markets nor
money, but barter their commodities, regarding rather utility
than price. They worship the gods, and both men and
women are supposed to foretell future events.
22. The chief cities of the Silures were, Sariconium,<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a>
Magna,<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> Gobanium,<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> and Venta<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> their capital. A Roman
colony possessed the city built on the Isca,<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> and called after
that name, for many years the station of the second or
Augustan legion, until it was transferred to the Valentian
province, and Rhutupis.<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> This was the primary station of
the Romans in Britannia Secunda.</p>

<p>23. The country of the Silures was long powerful,
particularly under Caractacus, who during nine years with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>stood
the Roman arms, and frequently triumphed over them,
until he was defeated by Ostorius, as he was preparing to
attack the Romans. Caractacus, however, escaped from the
battle, and in applying for assistance to the neighbouring
chieftains was delivered up to the Romans, by the artifices of
a Roman matron, Cartismandua, who had married Venutius,
chief of Brigantia. After this defeat the Silures bravely
defended their country till it was overrun by Veranius, and
being finally conquered by Frontinus, it was reduced into a
Roman province under the name of Britannia Secunda.</p>

<p>24. Two other tribes were subject to the Silures. First
the Ordovices, who inhabited the north towards the isle of
Mona;<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> and secondly the Dimeti&aelig;, who occupied the west,
where the promontory Octorupium<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> is situated, and from
whence is a passage of thirty miles<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> to Ireland. The cities
of the Dimeti&aelig; were Menapia<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> and Maridunum<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> the metropolis.
The Romans seized upon Lovantium<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> as their station.
Beyond these, and the borders of the Silures, were the
Ordovices, whose cities were Mediolanum<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> and Brannogenium.<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a>
The Sabrina, which rises in their mountains, is
justly reckoned one of the three largest rivers of Britain,
the Thamesis (Thames) and the Tavus (Tay) being the
other two. The name of the Ordovices is first distinguished
in history on account of the revenge which they took for
the captivity of their renowned chief. Hence they continually
harassed the Roman army, and would have succeeded
in annihilating their power, had not Agricola turned hither
his victorious arms, subdued the whole nation, and put the
greater part to the sword.</p>

<p>25. The territory situated north of the Ordovices, and
washed by the ocean, was formerly under their dominion.
These parts were certainly inhabited by the Cangiani, whose
chief city was Segontium,<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> near the Cangian promontory,<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a>
on the Minevian shore, opposite Mona,<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> an island long
distinguished as the residence of the druids. This island
contained many towns, though it was scarcely sixty miles in
circuit; and, as Pliny asserts, is distant from the colony of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
Camalodunum two hundred miles. The rivers of the
Cangiani were Tosibus,<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> called also Canovius, and the Deva,<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a>
which was their boundary. In this region is the stupendous
mountain Eriri.<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> Ordovicia, together with the regions of
the Cangiani and Carnabii, unless report deceives me, constituted
a province called Genania, under the reign of the
emperors subsequent to Trajan.</p>

<p>26. I now proceed to the Flavian province; but for want
of authentic documents, am unable to ascertain whether it
derived its name from Flavia Julia Helena, mother of Constantine
the Great, who was born in these parts, or from the
Flavian family.</p>

<p>27. Towards the river Deva were situated, in the first
place, the Carnabii.<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> Their principal places were Benon&aelig;,<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a>
Etocetum,<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> and Banchorium,<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> the last the most celebrated
monastery in the whole island, which being overthrown in
the dispute with Augustine was never afterwards restored;
and the mother of the rest, Uriconium,<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> esteemed one of the
largest cities in Britain. In the extreme angle of this
country, near the Deva, was the Roman colony Deva,<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> the
work of the twentieth legion, which was called Victrix, and
was formerly the defence of the region. This place is supposed
to be what is now termed West Chester.</p>

<p>28. Below these people stretched the kingdom, or rather
the republic, of the Cassii, called by Ptolemy Catieuchlani,
which arose from the union of two nations. Those nearest
the Sabrina were called the Dobuni, or, according to the
annals of Dio, the Boduni.<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> In their country the Thames
rises, and, proceeding through the territories of the Hedui,
Atrebates, Cassii, Bibroci, Trinobantes, and Cantii, after a
long course flows into the German Ocean. The cities of the
Dobuni were Salin&aelig;,<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> Branogena,<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> on the left of the Sabrina
[Severn], Alauna,<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> and the most venerable of all, Corinium,<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a>
a famous city supposed to have been built by Vespasian.
But Glevum,<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> situated in the extreme part of the kingdom,
towards the territory of the Silures, was occupied by a Roman
colony, which, according to the writers of those times,
was introduced by Claudius C&aelig;sar. Adjoining to these were
the Cassii, whose chief cities were Forum Dian&aelig;<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> and Verulamium.<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a>
But when the last was raised by the Romans to
the municipal rank, it obtained the pre-eminence over the
other cities. St. Alban the martyr was here born. This
city was involved in the ruin of Camalodunum<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> and Londinium,<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a>
in the insurrection of Bonduica, which is related by
Tacitus. The Cassii were conspicuous above the other
nations of the island; and C&aelig;sar in his second invasion had
the severest conflicts with their renowned chief Cassibellinus,
to whom many people were tributary; and was repulsed
by the Cassii in league with the Silures; to which Lucan
alludes:&mdash;"<i>Territa qu&aelig;sitis ostendit terga Britannis.</i>" But
on the coming of Claudius, they, with the neighbouring
people, were subdued, and their country reduced to a Roman
province, first called C&aelig;sariensis, and afterwards Flavia.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span></p><p>29. Near the Cassii, where the river Thamesis approaches
the ocean, was the region of the Trinobantes,<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> who not only
entered into alliance with the Romans, but resigned to them
Londinium their metropolis, and Camalodunum situated near
the sea, for the purpose of establishing colonies. In this
city was supposed to be born Flavia Julia Helena, the pious
wife of Constantine Chlorus and mother of Constantine the
Great, who was descended from the blood of the British
kings. It was the chief colony of the Romans in Britain,
and distinguished by a temple of Claudius, an image of
Victory, with many ornaments.<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> But Londinium was and
ever will be a city of great eminence. It was first named
Trinovantum, then Londinium, afterwards Augusta, and now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
again Londona. According to the chronicles it is more
ancient than Rome. It is situated upon the banks of the
Thamesis, and is the great emporium of many nations trading
by land or sea. This city was surrounded with a wall by
the empress Helena, the discoverer of the Holy Cross; and,
if reliance may be placed on tradition, which is not always
erroneous, was called Augusta, as Britain was distinguished
by the name of the Roman Island.</p>

<p>30. The boundary of this people towards the north was
the river Surius,<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> beyond which lived the Iceni, a famous
people divided into two tribes. The first of these, the Cenomanni,
dwelt to the north towards the Trinobantes and
Cassii, and bordered on the ocean towards the east. Their
cities were Durnomagus,<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> and their metropolis Venta.<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a>
Camboricum<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> was a Roman colony. A tongue of land
stretching into the sea towards the east was called Flavia
Extrema.<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> Their most remarkable rivers are the Garion,<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a>
the Surius,<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> and the Aufona<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> which falls into the bay of
Metaris.<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> Beyond the Aufona, bordering on the Carnabii,
Brigantes, and the ocean, lived the Coitani,<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> in a tract of
country overspread with woods, which, like all the woods
of Britain, was called Caledonia.<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> This is mentioned by
the historian Florus.<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> The chief city of the Coitani was
Rag&aelig;.<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> Besides this was Lindum,<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> a Roman colony, on the
eastern extremity of the province. The river Trivona<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a>
divides the whole country into two parts. The nation of
the Iceni, being of a warlike character, neglected husbandry
as well as the civil arts; they voluntarily joined the Romans;
but, revolting, and exciting others to follow their example,
were first subdued by Ostorius. A few years afterwards,
Pr&aelig;sutagus their king, at his decease, made C&aelig;sar and his
descendants his heirs. But the Romans, abusing the friendship
of these people and giving themselves up to every species<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
of debauchery, excited their resentment, and the Iceni with
their allies, under the warlike Bonduica, widow of Pr&aelig;sutagus,
destroyed their colonies, and massacred eighty thousand
Roman citizens. They were afterwards reduced by
the legate Suetonius, a man highly esteemed for prudence.</p>

<p>31. On the northern part of this region is the river Abus,<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a>
which falls into the ocean, and was one of the boundaries of
the province Maxima, as Seteja<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> was the other. This province
was also called the kingdom of Brigantia, because it comprehended
the region of that name inhabited by three nations.
At the eastern point,<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> where the promontories of Oxellum<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a>
and of the Brigantes<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> stretch into the sea, lived the Parisii,
whose cities were Petuaria<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> and Portus Felix.<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a></p>

<p>32. Above, but on the side of the Parisii, are the proper
Brigantes,<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> a numerous people who once gave law to the
whole province. Their towns were Epiacum,<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> Vinovium,<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a>
Cambodunum,<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> Cataracton,<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> Galacum,<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> Olicana,<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> and the
chief city Isurium.<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> Eboracum,<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> on the Urus,<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> was the
metropolis, first a colony of the Romans, called Sexta, from
being the station of the sixth legion, termed the Victorious,
and afterwards distinguished by the presence of many emperors,
and raised to the privileges of a municipal city.</p>

<p>33. This province is divided into two equal parts by a
chain of mountains called the Pennine Alps, which rising on
the confines of the Iceni and Carnabii, near the river Trivona,<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a>
extend towards the north in a continued series of
fifty miles.</p>

<p>34. The people to the west of this chain<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> are the Voluntii
and Sistuntii, who are united in a close confederacy.<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a> Their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
cities are Rerigonium,<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> Coccium,<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> and Lugubalium.<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> The
two last were occupied by Roman garrisons.</p>

<p>35. The northern frontier of this province was protected
by a wall<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> of stupendous magnitude built by the Romans
across the Isthmus, eighty miles in length, twelve feet high
and (<i>nine</i>) thick, strengthened with towers.</p>

<p>36. We collect from history, that these people were first
attacked by the emperor Claudius, then overrun by the legate
Ostorius, and finally defeated by Cerealis. By their voluntary
submission to Agricola they obtained peace. The
actions and unheard-of perfidy of their queen have disgraced
their name in history. These people were descended from
those powerful nations, who in search of new habitations
quitted their country, which was situated between the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
Danube, the Alps, and the Rhone.<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> Some of them afterwards
emigrated into Ireland, as appears from authentic
documents.</p>

<p>37. Further north were situated those powerful nations,
who in former times were known under the name of M&aelig;at&aelig;,
and from whom that fratricide Bassianus,<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> after the death of
his father, basely purchased peace. They possessed Ottadinia
towards the east, Gadenia, Selgovia, Novantia, and
further north Damnia.</p>

<p>38. Nearest the wall dwelt the Gadeni,<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> whose metropolis
was Curia.<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> The Ottadini<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> were situated nearer the sea.
Their chief city was Bremenium,<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a> and their rivers Tueda,<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a>
Alauna,<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> and the two Tinas,<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> which ran within the wall.</p>

<p>39. The Selgov&aelig;<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> inhabited the country to the west.
Their cities were Corbantorigum,<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> Uxellum,<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> and Trimontium,<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a>
which, according to ancient documents, was a long
time occupied by a Roman garrison. The principal rivers
of this region were Novius,<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> Deva,<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> and partly the Ituna.<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a></p>

<p>40. The Novantes<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> dwell beyond the Deva, in the extreme
part of the island, near the sea, and opposite Ireland. In
their country was the famous Novantum Chersonesus,<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>tant
twenty-eight miles from Ireland, and esteemed by the
ancients the most northern promontory of Britain,<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> though
without sufficient reason. Their metropolis was Lucophibia,
or Cas&aelig; Candid&aelig;;<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> their rivers Abrasuanus,<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> Jena,<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> and
Deva,<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> which was the boundary towards the east.</p>

<p>41. The Damnii<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a> dwelt to the north of the Novantes, the
Selgov&aelig;, and the Gadeni, and were separated from them by
the chain of the Uxellan mountains.<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> They were a very
powerful people, but lost a considerable portion of their territory
when the wall was built, being subdued and spoiled by
the Caledonians. Besides which, a Roman garrison occupied
Vanduarium<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> to defend the wall.</p>

<p>42. In this part, Britain, as if again delighted with the
embraces of the sea, becomes narrower than elsewhere, in
consequence of the rapid influx of the two estuaries,
Bodotria and Clotta.<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> Agricola first secured this isthmus
with fortifications, and the emperor Antoninus<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> erected
another wall celebrated in history, which extended nearly
five and thirty miles, in order to check the incursions of the
barbarians. It was repaired, and strengthened with eleven
towers, by the general &AElig;tius. These regions probably
constituted that province, which, being recovered by the
victorious arms of the Romans under Theodosius, was supposed
to have been named Valentia, in honour of the family
from whom the reigning emperor was descended.</p>

<p>43. Beyond the wall lay the province Vespasiana. This
is the Caledonian region so much coveted by the Romans,
and so bravely defended by the natives, facts which the
Roman historians, generally too silent in regard to such
things, have amply detailed. In these districts may be seen
the river Tavus,<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a> which appears to separate the country into
two parts. There are also found the steep and horrid Gram<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>pian
hills, which divide the province. In this region was
fought that famous battle between Agricola and Galgacus,
which was so decisive in favour of the Romans.<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> The
magnitude of the works at this day displays the power
of the Romans, and the ancient mode of castrametation;
for, in the place where the battle was fought, certain persons
of our order, who passed that way, affirmed that they saw
immense camps, and other proofs which corroborated the
relation of Tacitus.</p>

<p>44. The nations which were subject to the Romans shall
now follow in their order. Beyond the Isthmus, as far as the
Tavus, lived the Horestii.<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> Their cities, which before the
building of the wall belonged to the Damnii, were Alauna,<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a>
Lindum,<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> and Victoria,<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> the last not less glorious in reality
than in name. It was built by Agricola on the Tavus,
twenty miles above its mouth.</p>

<p>45. Above these, beyond the Tavus, which formed the
boundary, lived the Vecturones or Venricones,<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a> whose chief
city was Orrea,<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> and their rivers &AElig;sica<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> and Tina.<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a></p>

<p>46. The Taixali<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> inhabited the coast beyond the boundaries
of the Vecturones. Their principal city was Devana,<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> and
their rivers the Deva<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a> and Ituna.<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> A part of the Grampian
hills, which extends like a promontory into the sea, as it were
to meet Germany, borrows its name from them.<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a></p>

<p>47. To the west of these, beyond the Grampian hills, lived
the Vacomagi,<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a> who possessed an extensive tract of country.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
Their cities were Tuessis,<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> Tamea,<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> and Banatia.<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> Ptoroton,<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a>
situated at the mouth of the Varar,<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a> on the coast, was at the
same time a Roman station, and the chief city of the province.
The most remarkable rivers of this region, after the
Varar, which formed the boundary, were the Tuessis<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> and
Celnius.<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a></p>

<p>48. Within the Vacomagi, and the Tavus, lived the
Damnii Albani,<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> a people little known, being wholly secluded
among lakes and mountains.</p>

<p>49. Lower down, to the banks of the Clotta, inhabited the
Attacotti,<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> a people once formidable to all Britain. In this
part is situated the great lake formerly called Lyncalidor,<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a>
at the mouth of which the city of Alcluith<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a> was built by the
Romans, and not long afterwards received its name from
Theodosius, who recovered that province from the barbarians.
These people deserved high praise for having sustained the
attacks of the enemy after the subjugation of the neighbouring
provinces.</p>

<p>50. This province was named Vespasiana, in honour of
the Flavian family, to which the emperor Domitian owed his
origin, and under whom it was conquered. If I am not
mistaken, it was called under the later emperors Thule,
which Claudian mentions in these lines:</p>

<p style="margin-left:6em;">
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">"Incaluit Pictorum sanguine Thule,</span><br />
Scotorum cumulos flevit glacialis Hierne."<br />
</p>

<p>But this country was so short a time under the power of the
Romans, that posterity cannot ascertain its appellations or
subjugation. We have now examined in a cursory manner
the state of Britain under the Romans; we shall next as
briefly treat of the country of the Caledonians.</p>


<h4>CONCERNING CALEDONIA.</h4>

<p>51. Although all the parts of Britain lying beyond the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
Isthmus may be termed Caledonia, yet the proper Caledonians
dwelt beyond the Varar, from which a line drawn accurately
points out the boundary of the Roman empire in Britain.
The hithermost part of the island was at different times in
their possession, and the remainder, as we have related, was
occupied by barbarous Britons. The ancient documents of
history afford some information thus far; but beyond the
Varar the light is extinct, and we are enveloped in darkness.<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a>
Although we know that the Romans erected altars there to
mark the limits of their empire, and that Ulysses, tossed by a
violent tempest, here fulfilled his vows; yet the thick woods
and a continued chain of rugged mountains forbid all further
research. We must therefore be satisfied with the following
information, gleaned from the wandering merchants of the
Britons, which we leave for the use of posterity.</p>

<p>52. The Caledonians,<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> properly so called, inhabited the
country to the westward of the Varar, and part of their
territory was covered by the extensive forest called the Caledonian
wood.</p>

<p>53. Less considerable people dwelt near the coast. Of
these the Cant&aelig;<a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> were situated beyond the Varar, and the
above-mentioned altars, to the river Loxa,<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> and in their
territory was the promontory Penoxullum.<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a></p>

<p>54. Next in order is the river Abona,<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> and the inhabitants
near it, the Logi.<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> Then the river Ila,<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> near which lived
the Carnabii,<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> the most remote of the Britons. These
people being subdued by the propr&aelig;tor Ostorius, and
impatiently bearing the Roman yoke, joined the Cant&aelig;, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
tradition relates, and, crossing the sea, here fixed their
residence. Britain in these parts branches out into many
promontories, the chief of which, the extremity of Caledonia,
was called by the ancients Vinvedrum, and afterwards
Verubium.<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a></p>

<p>55. After these people were placed the Catini,<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> and the
Mert&aelig;<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> further inland near the Logi. In these regions was
the promontory of the Orcades,<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a> contiguous to which are the
islands of that name. Beyond this part flowed the Nab&aelig;us,<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a>
which bounded the territory of the Carnabii.</p>

<p>56. In the lower part of this region were situated the
Carnonac&aelig;,<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a> in whose territories was the promontory Ebudum,<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a>
beyond which the ocean forms a large bay, formerly
called Volsas.<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> The lower coast of this bay was inhabited
by the Cerones;<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> and beyond the Itys,<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a> the territory of the
Creones extended as far as the Longus.<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a> The promontory
stretching from thence, and washed by the ocean and the bay
Lelanus,<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> is named after the inhabitants the Epidii.<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a></p>

<p>57. I cannot repass the Varar without expressing my
wonder that the Romans, in other respects so much distinguished
for judgment and investigation, should have
entertained the absurd notion, that the remainder of Britain
exceeded in length and breadth the regions which they had
subdued and occupied. There is, however, sufficient evidence
that such was their opinion; for whoever attentively considers
their insatiable desire of rule, and reflects on the labour
employed in the erection of those stupendous works which
excite the wonder of the world, in order to exclude an
enemy scarcely worthy of their notice or resentment, must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
in this respect, as in all others, adore the providence of the
Divine Being, to whom all kingdoms are subject, and
perpetual glory is due, now and for ever. Amen!</p>

against the northern tribes, has furnished matter of dispute to many of our
antiquaries. The researches of others, particularly Horsley, have, however,
set this question at rest. From their information, joined to the scanty evidence
of history, it has been proved that three walls or ramparts were
erected by the Romans at different times, to secure the northern frontier of
their dominions in Britain.
</p><p>
The first was a rampart of earth, from the Solway Frith to the Tine,
raised by Hadrian about the year 120; but its form and construction have
not been satisfactorily ascertained. It was, however, evidently nothing
more than a line intended to obstruct the passage of an enemy between the
stations which constituted the real defences of the frontier.
</p><p>
The second was raised by Lollius Urbicus under the reign of Antoninus
Pius, about 140, between the Friths of Forth and Clyde. This was likewise
of earth, though perhaps faced with stone, and, like that of Hadrian,
seems to have been intended as a line connecting the chain of stations,
which formed a new barrier on the advance of the Roman arms. In the
course of both these was a military road communicating from station to
station.
</p><p>
The last and most important is that begun by Severus, after his expedition
against the Caledonians, about 208. It runs nearly over the same
ground as that of Hadrian; but is a complete and well combined system
of fortification. From an examination of its remains it appears to have
been built of stone, fifteen feet high and nine thick. It had parapet and
ditch, a military road, and was defended by eighteen greater stations placed
at intervals of three to six miles; eighty-three castles at intervals of six
to eight furlongs, and, as it is imagined, a considerable number of turrets
placed at shorter distances.
</p><p>
Either from superior sagacity or superior information, Richard clearly
distinguishes these three walls, which so much puzzled later writers, though
it must be confessed that in other places he has suffered himself to be led
into some errors in regard to their situation, and the persons by whom they
were erected.&mdash;See b. ii. ch. 1, sect. 22, 27, 36, 37; ch. 2, sect. 17, 23.

<h3><a name="Chapter_VII" id="Chapter_VII">CHAP. VII.</a></h3>


<p>The different parts of Britain having been cursorily
examined according to my original design, it seems necessary,
before I proceed to a description of the islands, to attend to
a doubt suggested by a certain person.<a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a> "Where," asks he,
"are the vestiges of those cities and names which you
commemorate? There are none." This question may be
answered by another: Where are now the Assyrians, Parthians,
Sarmatians, Celtiberians? None will be bold enough
to deny the existence of those nations. Are there not also
at this time many countries and cities bearing the same
names as they did two or three thousand years ago? Judea,
Italy, Gaul, Britain, are as clearly known now as in former
times; Londinium is still styled in the common language,
with a slight change of sound, London. The negligence and
inattention of our ancestors in omitting to collect and preserve
such documents as might have been serviceable in this
particular, are not deserving of heavy censure, for scarcely
any but those in holy orders employed themselves in writing
books, and such even esteemed it inconsistent with their sacred
office to engage in such profane labours. I rather think I
may without danger, and without offence, transmit to posterity
that information which I have drawn from a careful examination
and accurate scrutiny of ancient records concerning the
state of this kingdom in former periods. The good abbat,
indeed, had nearly inspired me with other sentiments, by thus
seeming to address me: Are you ignorant how short a time
is allotted us in this world; that the greatest exertions
cannot exempt us from the appellation of unprofitable
servants; and that all our studies should be directed to the
purpose of being useful to others? Of what service are
these things, but to delude the world with unmeaning trifles?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
To these remarks I answer with propriety. Is then every
honest gratification forbidden? Do not such narratives
exhibit proofs of Divine Providence? Does it not hence
appear, that an evangelical sermon concerning the death and
merits of Christ enlightened and subdued a world overrun
with Gentile superstitions? To the reply, that such things
are properly treated of in systems of chronology, I rejoin:
Nor is it too much to know that our ancestors were not, as
some assert, Autochthones, sprung from the earth; but that
God opened the book of nature to display his omnipotence,
such as it is described in the writings of Moses. When the
abbat answered, that works which were intended merely to
acquire reputation for their authors from posterity, should
be committed to the flames, I confess with gratitude that I
repented of this undertaking. The remainder of the work
is therefore only a chronological abridgment, which I present
to the reader, whom I commend to the goodness and protection
of God; and at the same time request, that he will
pray for me to our holy Father, who is merciful and inclined
to forgiveness.</p>

But let no one lightly imagine that the Romans had not
many others besides those above-mentioned. I have only
commemorated the more celebrated. For who can doubt
that they who, as conquerors of the world, were at liberty to
choose, did not select places fitted for their purposes? They
for the most part took up their abode in fortresses which
they constructed for themselves.</p>

<h3>CHAP. VIII.</h3>


<p>1. Having now finished our survey of Albion, we shall
describe the neighbouring country, Hibernia or Ireland, with
the same brevity.</p>

<p>2. Hibernia is situated more westerly than any other
country except England; but as it does not extend so far<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>
north, so it stretches further than England towards the south,
and the Spanish province of Tarraconensis, from which it is
separated by the ocean.<a name="FNanchor_666_666" id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a></p>

<p>3. The sea which flows between Britain and Hibernia is
subject to storms, and according to Solinus, is navigable only
during a few days in summer. Midway between the two
countries is the island called Mon&oelig;da,<a name="FNanchor_667_667" id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a> but now Manavia.</p>

<p>4. According to Bede, Hibernia is preferable to Britain,
on account of its situation, salubrity, and serene air, insomuch
that snow seldom remains more than three days, nor is it usual
to make hay for the winter, or build stalls for cattle.</p>

<p>5. No reptile is found there, nor does it maintain a viper
or serpent; for serpents frequently carried from England
have died on approaching the shore. Indeed almost all
things in the island are antidotes to poison. We have seen an
infusion of scraped pieces of bark brought from Hibernia,
given to persons bitten by serpents, which immediately deprived
the poison of its force, and abated the swelling.</p>

<p>6. This island, according to the venerable Bede, is rich in
milk and honey; nor is it without vines. It abounds with
fish and birds, and affords deer and goats for the chase.</p>

<p>7. The inhabitants, says Mela, are more than other nations
uncivilized and without virtue, and those who have a little
knowledge are wholly destitute of piety. Solinus calls them
an inhospitable and warlike people. The conquerors, after
drinking the blood of the slain, daub their faces with the
remainder. They know no distinction between right and
wrong. When a woman brings forth a son, she places its
first food on the point of her husband's sword, and, introducing
it into the mouth of the infant, wishes according to the
custom of the country, that he may die amidst arms and in
battle. Those who are fond of ornaments adorn the hilts of
their swords with the teeth of marine animals, which they
polish to a degree of whiteness equal to ivory; for the principal
glory of a man consists in the splendour of his arms.</p>

<p>8. Agrippa states the length of Hibernia to be six hundred
miles, and the breadth three hundred. It was formerly in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>habited
by twenty tribes, of whom (<i>fourteen</i><a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a>) lived on the
coast.</p>

<p>9. This is the true country of the Scots, who emigrating
from hence added a third nation to the Britons and Picts in
Albion. But I cannot agree with Bede, who affirms that the
Scots were foreigners. For, according to the testimony of
other authors, I conceive they derived their origin from
Britain, situated at no considerable distance, passed over from
thence, and obtained a settlement in this island. It is certain
that the Damnii, Voluntii, Brigantes, Cangi, and other
nations, were descended from the Britons, and passed over
thither after Divitiacus, or Claudius, or Ostorius, or other victorious
generals had invaded their original countries. Lastly,
the ancient language which resembles the old British and
Gallic tongues, affords another argument, as is well known
to persons skilled in both languages.<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a></p>

<p>10. The Deucaledonian Ocean washes the northern side of
Hibernia; the Vergivian and Internal the eastern, the Cantabric
the south, as the great British or Atlantic Ocean does
the western. According to this order, we shall give a description
of the island and the most remarkable places.</p>

<p>11. The Rhobogdii occupied the coast of the island next
to the Deucaledonian Sea. Their metropolis was Rhobogdium.
In the eastern part of their territories was situated the
promontory of the same name; in the Western the
Promontorium Boreum, or Northern Promontory. Their
rivers were the Banna, Darabouna, Argitta, and Vidua;
and towards the south, mountains separated them from the
Scotti.</p>

<p>12. On the coast between the northern and Venicnian
Promontory, and as far as the mouth of the Rhebeus, dwelt
the Venicnii. To them the contiguous islands owe their
name. Their capital was Rheba. The Nagnat&aelig; dwelt
below the Rhebeus as far as the Libnius, and their celebrated
metropolis was called after them. The Auterii lived in a
recess of the bay of Ausoba, towards the south, and their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
chief city was named after them. The Concangii occupied
the lower part of the same region, near the southern confines
of which flowed the river Senus, a noble river, on which
was situated their chief city Macobicum. Hibernia in this
part being contracted, terminates in a narrow point. The
Velatorii inhabited the country near the southern promontory
by the river Senus; their metropolis was Regia, and their
river Durius. The Lucani were situated where the river
Ibernus flows into the ocean.</p>

<p>13. The southern side of the island stretched from the
Promontorium Austriacum, or Southern Promontory, to the
Sacred Promontory. Here lived the Ibernii, whose metropolis
was Rhufina. Next was the river Dobona, and the people
called Vodi&aelig;, whose promontory of the same name lies
opposite to the Promontorium Antivest&aelig;um in England, at
about the distance of one hundred and forty-five miles. Not
far from thence is the river Dabrona, the boundary of the
Brigantes, who have also the river Briga for their limit, and
whose chief city is called Brigantia.</p>

<p>14. The part of this island which reaches from the Sacred
Promontory as far as Rhobogdium is called the Eastern.
The Menapii, inhabiting the Sacred Promontory, had their
chief city upon the river Modona called by the same name.
From this part to Menapia<a name="FNanchor_670_670" id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a> in Dimetia, the distance,
according to Pliny, is thirty miles. One of these countries,
but which is uncertain, gave birth to Carausius. Beyond
these people the Cauci had their metropolis Dunum [Down];
and the river Oboca washed their boundaries. Both these
nations were undoubtedly of Teutonic origin; but it is not
known at what precise time their ancestors first passed over,
though most probably a little while before C&aelig;sar's arrival in
Britain.</p>

<p>15. Beyond these were the Eblan&aelig;, whose chief city was
Mediolanum, upon the river L&oelig;bius. More to the north
was Lebarum, the city of the Voluntii, whose rivers were
Vinderus and Buvinda. The Damnii occupied the part of
the island lying above these people, and contiguous to the
Rhobogdii. Their chief city was Dunum [Down], where
St. Patrick, St. Columba, and St. Bridget are supposed to be
buried in one tomb.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span></p>
<p>16. It remains now to give some account of those people
who lived in the interior parts. The Coriondii bordered
upon the Cauci and Menapii, above the Brigantes; the Scotti possessed the remaining part of the island, which
from them took the name of Scotia. Among many of their
cities, the remembrance of two only has reached our times:
the one Rheba, on the lake and river Rhebeus; the other
Ibernia, situated at the east side of the river Senus.</p>

<p>17. I cannot omit mentioning in this place that the
Damnii, Voluntii, Brigantes, and Cangiani were all nations
of British origin, who being either molested by neighbouring
enemies, or unable to pay the heavy tribute exacted of them,
gradually passed over into this country in search of new
settlements. With respect to the Menapii, Cauci, and some
other people, it has been before remarked that many things
occur which cannot safely be relied upon. Tacitus relates
that Hibernia was more frequented by foreigners than
Albion. But in that case, the ancients would undoubtedly
have left us a more ample and credible account of this island.
While I am writing a description of Hibernia, it seems right
to add, that it was reduced under the Roman power, not by
arms, but by fear: and moreover, that Ptolemy, in his
second map of Europe, and other celebrated geographers,
have erred in placing it at too great a distance from Britain,
and from the northern part of the province Secunda, as
appears from their books and maps.</p>

<p>18. North of Hibernia are the Hebudes, five<a name="FNanchor_671_671" id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a> in number,
the inhabitants of which know not the use of corn, but live
on fish and milk. They are all, according to Solinus, subject
to one chief, for they are only divided from each other by
narrow straits. The chief possessed no peculiar property
but was maintained by general contribution: he was bound
by certain laws; and lest avarice should seduce him from
equity, he learned justice from poverty, having no house nor
property, and being maintained at the public expense. He
had no wife; but took by turns any woman for whom he
felt an inclination, and hence had neither a wish nor hope<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
for children. Some persons have written concerning these
Hebudes, that during winter darkness continues for the space
of thirty days? but C&aelig;sar upon diligent inquiry found this
assertion untrue, and only discovered by certain water-measures
of time that the nights were shorter here than in Gaul.</p>

<p>19. The Orcades, according to some accounts, are distant
from the Hebudes seven days and nights' sail; but this
is erroneous. They are thirty in number, and contiguous to
each other. They were uninhabited, without wood, and
abounded with reeds: several were formed only of sand and
rocks, as may be collected from Solinus and others.</p>

<p>20. Thule, the last of the British isles, is placed by Mela
opposite to<a name="FNanchor_672_672" id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a> the coast of the Belg&aelig;. It has been celebrated
in Greek and Roman verse. Thus the Mantuan Homer
says,&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
"Et tibi serviat ultima Thule."<br />
</p>

<p>Here are no nights during the solstice when the sun passes
the sign of Cancer; and on the other hand, in the winter
there are no days, as Pliny asserts. These circumstances
are supposed to happen for six whole months. The inhabitants,
as Solinus affirms, in the beginning of the spring
live among their cattle upon herbs, then upon milk, and lay
up fruits against the winter. They have their women in
common without marriages. Thule, according to the same
author, abounds in fruits. At the distance of a day's sail
from Thule the sea is difficult to pass through, and frozen;
it is by some called Cronium. From Thule to Caledonia is
two days' sail.</p>

<p>21. The isle of Thanatos<a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a> is bounded by a narrow channel,
and separated from the continent of Britain by a small
estuary called the Wantsum.<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a> It is rich in pasture and corn.
According to Isiodorus, its soil is not only salubrious to
itself, but to others, for no snakes live in it, and the earth
being carried to a distance destroys them. It is not far
distant from Rhutupis.<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a></p>

<p>22. The isle of Vecta,<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a> conquered by Vespasian, is thirty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
miles in length, on the side next to the Belg&aelig;, from east to
west, and twelve from north to south. In the eastern part it
is six miles, in the western three, from the above-mentioned
southern shore of Britain.</p>

<p>23. Besides the isles just specified, there were VII Acmod&aelig;,<a name="FNanchor_677_677" id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a>
Ricnea,<span style="vertical-align: super; font-size:.8em;"><a href="#a_998">[677A]</a><a name="A" id="A"></a></span>
Silimnus,<span style="vertical-align: super; font-size:.8em;"><a href="#a_997">[677B]</a><a name="B" id="B"></a></span>
Andros,<span style="vertical-align: super; font-size:.8em;"><a href="#a_996">[677C]</a><a name="C" id="C"></a></span>
Sigdiles,<span style="vertical-align: super; font-size:.8em;"><a href="#a_995">[677D]</a><a name="D" id="D"></a></span>
XL Vindilios,<span style="vertical-align: super; font-size:.8em;"><a href="#a_994">[677E]</a><a name="E" id="E"></a></span>
Sarna,<a name="FNanchor_678_678" id="FNanchor_678_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> C&aelig;sarea,<a name="FNanchor_679_679" id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a> and Cassiterides.
<a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a></p>
<p>24. The island Sena, opposite the Ossismican<a name="FNanchor_681_681" id="FNanchor_681_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a> coast, is
according to Mela famous for the oracle of the Gallic deity,
of whom the priestesses, sanctified by perpetual virginity,
are said to have been nine in number. The Gauls call them
Sen&aelig;, and suppose them gifted with singular powers; that
they raise the winds and the seas with incantations, change
themselves into what animals they please, and cure disorders
which in other places yield to no remedy; that they have the
knowledge of future events, and prophesy. They are not
favourable except to mariners, and only to such as go thither
for the purpose of consulting them.</p>

<p>25. The rest of the isles of smaller size and consequence
which lie round Albion will be better perceived and known
by the inspection of the annexed map<a name="FNanchor_682_682" id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a> than from any description.
Here, therefore, we stop, and anxiously commend our
labours to the favour and judgment of the benevolent reader.</p>

<p>The first book of the geographical Commentary on the
situation of Britain, and those stations which the Romans
erected in that island, is happily finished, through the assistance
of God, by the hand of Richard, servant of Christ and
monk of Westminster. Thanks be to God!</p>

III. Some persons will perhaps say that this kind of work is
not absolutely necessary either for divine worship or greater
things. But let them know that leisure hours may be
dedicated to the study of the antiquities of our country
without any derogation from the sacred character. Yet
if censorious people envy us such pleasures at leisure hours,
hastening to the end and almost arrived at the goal, we here
check our steps.</p>

<p>IV. In the beginning, the Almighty Creator made this
world, inhabited by us and other creatures, out of nothing,
in the space of six days.</p>

<p>V. In the year of the world 1656, the Creator, to punish
the increasing wickedness of mankind, sent a flood upon the
earth, which, overwhelming the whole world, destroyed every
living creature except those which had entered the ark, and
whose progeny replenished the new world with colonies of
living beings.</p>

<p>VI. 3000. About this time some persons affirm that Britain
was cultivated and first inhabited, when it was visited by the
Greek and Ph&oelig;nician merchants. Nor are those wanting
who believe that London was shortly after built by a king
called Bryto.</p>

<p>VII. 3228. The brothers Romulus and Remus laid the
foundation of Rome, which in time became the common
terror of all nations.</p>

<p>VIII. 3600. The Senones, having emigrated from Britain,
passed through Gaul, with the intent to invade Italy and
attack Rome.</p>

<p>IX. 3650. The Belg&aelig; entered this country, and the Celta
occupied the region deserted by the Senones. Divitiacus
king of the &AElig;dui soon afterwards passed over with an army
and subdued great part of this kingdom. About this time
the Britons who were expelled by the Belg&aelig; emigrated to
Ireland, formed a settlement, and were thenceforward called
Scoti.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span></p>

<p>X. 3943. Cassibelinus waged war with the maritime
states.<a name="FNanchor_683_683" id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a></p>

<p>XI. 3946. C&aelig;sar overcame the Germans, Gauls, and also
the Britons, to whom, before this time, even the name of the
Romans was unknown. The conqueror, having received
hostages, rendered the people tributary.</p>

<p>XII. 3947. At length coming a second time into this
country, upon the invitation, as he pretended, of the Trinobantes,
he waged war with Cassibelinus king of the Cassii.
Suetonius, however, asserts, with greater probability, that he
was allured by the costly pearls of Britain.</p>

<p>XIII. 4044. The emperor Claudius passed over to
Britain, and in the space of six months, almost without
effusion of blood, reduced a great part of the island, which
he ordered to be called C&aelig;sariensis.</p>

<p>XIV. 4045. Vespasian, at that time in a private station,
being sent by the emperor Claudius with the second legion
into this country, attacked the Belg&aelig; and Damnonii, and
having fought thirty-two battles and taken twenty cities,
reduced them under the Roman power, together with the
Isle of Wight.</p>

<p>XV. 4047. The Romans occupied Therm&aelig; and Glebon.</p>

<p>XVI. 4050. Ostorius the Roman general, after a war of
nine years, overcame Caractacus king of the Silures, great
part of Britain was reduced into a province, and the colony
of Camalodunum founded.</p>

<p>XVII. 4052. Certain cities of the Belg&aelig; were yielded by
the Romans to Cogibundus, that he might form a kingdom.
About this time the Cangi and Brigantes went over and
settled in Ireland.</p>

<p>XVIII. 4061. The emperor Nero, having no courage for
military enterprises, nearly lost Britain; for under him its
two greatest cities were taken and destroyed. Bonduica, in
order to revenge the injury offered to her by the Romans,
rose in arms, burned the Roman colonies of London, Camalodunum,
and the municipal town Verulamium, and slew more
than eighty thousand Roman citizens. She was at length
overcome by Suetonius, who amply avenged the loss, by
slaughtering an equal number of her subjects.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span></p>
<p>XIX. 4073. Cerealis conquered the Brigantes.</p>

<p>XX. 4076. Frontinus punished the Ordovices.</p>

<p>XXI. 4080. Agricola after a severe engagement subdued
Galgacus king of the Caledonians. He ordered all the
island to be examined by a fleet, and having sailed round its
coasts, added the Orcades to the Roman empire.</p>

<p>XXII. 4120. The emperor Hadrian himself came into
the island, and separated one part of it from the other by an
immense wall.</p>

<p>XXIII. 4140. Urbicus being sent hither by Antoninus
Pius, distinguished himself by his victories.</p>

<p>XXIV. 4150. Aurelius Antoninus also obtained victories
over some of the Britons.</p>

<p>XXV. 4160. Britain was enlightened by the introduction
of Christianity, during the reign of Lucius, who first
submitted himself to the cross of Christ.</p>

<p>XXVI. 4170. The Romans were driven from the
Vespasian province. About this time it is supposed that
king Reuda came with his people, the Picts, from the
islands into Britain.</p>

<p>XXVII. 4207. The emperor Severus, passing over into
Britain, repaired the wall built by the Romans, which had
been ruined, and died not long after, by the visitation of
God, at York.</p>

<p>XXVIII. 4211. Bassianus (Caracalla) obtained a venal
peace from the M&aelig;at&aelig;.</p>

<p>XXIX. 4220. During these times the Roman armies confined
themselves within the wall, and all the island enjoyed
a profound peace.</p>

<p>XXX. 4290. Carausius, having assumed the purple,
seized upon Britain; but ten years afterwards it was recovered
by Asclepiodotus.</p>

<p>XXXI. 4304. A cruel and inveterate persecution, in
which within the space of a month seventeen thousand
martyrs suffered in the cause of Christ. This persecution
spread over the sea, and the Britons, Alban, Aaron, and
Julius, with great numbers of men and women, were
condemned to a happy death.</p>

<p>XXXII. 4306. Constantius, a man of the greatest
humanity, having conquered Allectus, died at Eboracum in
the sixteenth year of his reign.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span></p>

<p>XXXIII. 4307. Constantine, afterwards called the Great,
son of Constantius by Helena, a British woman, was created
emperor in Britain; and Ireland voluntarily became tributary
to him.</p>

<p>XXXIV. 4320. The Scoti entered Britain under the
conduct of the king Fergusius, and here fixed their residence.</p>

<p>XXXV. Theodosius slew Maximus the tyrant three
miles from Aquileia. Maximus having nearly drained
Britain of all its warlike youth, who followed the footsteps
of his tyranny over Gaul, the fierce transmarine nations of
the Scots from the south, and the Picts from the north, perceiving
the island without soldiers and defenceless, oppressed
it and laid it waste during a long series of years.</p>

<p>XXXVI. 4396. The Britons indignantly submitting to
the attacks of the Scots and Picts, sent to Rome, made an
offer of submission, and requested assistance against their
enemies. A legion being accordingly despatched to their
assistance, slew a great multitude of the barbarians, and
drove the remainder beyond the confines of Britain. The
legion, upon its departure homewards, advised its allies to
construct a wall between the two estuaries, to restrain the
enemy. A wall was accordingly made in an unskilful manner,
with a greater proportion of turf than stone, which was
of no advantage; for on the departure of the Romans the
former enemies returned in ships, slew, trampled on, and devoured
all things before them like a ripened harvest.</p>

<p>XXXVII. 4400. Assistance being again entreated, the
Romans came, and with the aid of the Britons drove the
enemy beyond sea, and built a wall from sea to sea, not as
before with earth, but with solid stone, between the fortresses
erected in that part to curb the enemy. On the southern
coast, where an invasion of the Saxons was apprehended, he
erected watch towers. This was the work of Stilicho, as
appears from Claudian.</p>

<p>XXXVIII. 4411. Rome, the seat of the fourth and
greatest of the monarchies, was seized by the Goths, as
Daniel prophesied, in the year one thousand one hundred
and sixty-four after its foundation.</p>

<p>From this time ceased the Roman empire in Britain, four<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>
hundred and sixty-five years after the arrival of Julius
C&aelig;sar.</p>

<p>XXXIX. 4446. The Roman legion retiring from Britain,
and refusing to return, the Scots and Picts ravaged all the
island from the north as far as the wall, the guards of which
being slain, taken prisoners, or driven away, and the wall
itself broken through, the predatory enemy then poured into
the country. An epistle was sent filled with tears and sorrows
to Fl. &AElig;tius, thrice consul, in the twenty-third year of
Theodosius, begging the assistance of the Roman power, but
without effect.</p>

<h3>CHAP. II.</h3>


<p>1. Having followed truth as far as possible, if any thing
should occur not strictly consistent with it, I request it may
not be imputed to me as a fault. Confining myself closely
to the rules and laws of history, I have collected all the
accounts of other persons which I found most accurate and
deserving of credit. The reader must not expect any thing
beyond an enumeration of those emperors and Roman governors
who had authority over this island. With an account
of these I shall close my book.</p>

<p>2. Julius C&aelig;sar the dictator was the first of the Romans
who invaded Britain with an army, during the reign of Cassibelinus;
but, although he defeated the inhabitants in one
battle, and occupied the coast, as Tacitus observes, he rather
seems to have shown the way to his successors than to have
given them possession.</p>

<p>3. In a short time the civil wars succeeding, the arms of
the chiefs were turned against the republic. Britain was
also long neglected by the advice of Augustus and the command
of Tiberius. It is certain that Caligula intended to
enter Britain; but his quick temper and proneness to change,
or the unsuccessful attempts against the Germans, prevented
him.</p>

<p>4. Claudius, however, carried war into Britain which no
Roman emperor since Julius C&aelig;sar had reached, and, having
transported his legions and allies without danger or bloodshed,
in a few days reduced a part of the island. He afterwards
sent over Vespasian, at that time in a private station,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
who fought two and thirty battles with the enemy, and added
to the Roman empire two very powerful nations, with their
kings, twenty cities, and the isle of Vecta, contiguous to
Britain. He overcame the remainder by means of Cneas
Sentius and Aulus Plautius. For these exploits he obtained
a great triumph.</p>

<p>5. To him succeeded Ostorius Scapula, a man famous in
war, who reduced the nearest part of Britain into a province,
and added the colony of the veterans, Camalodunum. Certain
cities were delivered up to the chief Cogibundus, who,
according to Tacitus, remained faithful till the accession of
Trajan to the empire.</p>

<p>6. Avitus Didius Gallus kept possession of what his predecessors
had acquired, a few posts only being removed further
into the interior, in order to obtain the credit of extending
his dominion.</p>

<p>7. Didius Verannius, who succeeded, died within a year.</p>

<p>8. Suetonius Paulinus continued prosperous for two years.
The tribes being reduced and garrisons established, he
attacked the isle of Mona, because it gave succour to the
rebellious and afforded opportunities for invasion. For the
absence of the governor removing all fear, the Britons began
to recover courage, and rose in arms under the conduct of
Bonduica, a woman of royal descent. Having reduced the
troops scattered in the garrisons, they attacked the colony<a name="FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a>
itself, as the seat of slavery, and in the height of rage and
victory, exercised every species of savage barbarity. Had
not Paulinus, on receiving the intelligence, luckily hastened
to crush the revolt, Britain must have been lost. But the
fortune of one battle restored it to its former submission.
Many of the natives, from the consciousness of their defection,
and fear of the governor, continued under arms.</p>

<p>9. Suetonius, in other respects an illustrious man, but
arrogant to the vanquished and prompt to avenge his own
injuries, being likely to exercise severity, he was replaced by
Petronius Turpilianus, who was more merciful, a stranger to
the offences of the enemy, and therefore more likely to be
softened by their repentance. Having settled the disturbances,
he gave up the province to Trebellius Maximus.</p>

<p>10. Trebellius, being of a slothful disposition and unused<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>
to war, retained the province by gentleness. The barbarous
Britons ceasing to be ignorant of luxury, and the termination
of civil wars, gave him an excuse for inactivity. But discord
called forth his exertions; for the soldiery, when released
from military labours, grew wanton from too much
rest. Trebellius, having evaded the rage of the army by
flight, was shortly allowed to resume the command, the licentiousness
of the soldiery becoming as it were a composition
for the safety of the general. This sedition ended without
bloodshed.</p>

<p>11. Nor did Vectius Bolanus, although the civil wars still
continued, harass Britain by restoring discipline. There
was the same inactivity towards the enemy, and the same insubordination
in the garrisons; but Bolanus, being a good
man and not disliked, acquired affection instead of authority.</p>

<p>12. But when, with the rest of the world, Vespasian had
recovered Britain, we see distinguished generals, famous
armies, and the enemy dispirited: Petilius Cerealis immediately
excited terror by attacking the state of the Brigantes,
which was esteemed the most populous of the province.
Many battles were fought, some of which were bloody, and
a great part of the Brigantian territory was either conquered
or invaded.</p>

<p>13. But although Cerealis had diminished the care and
fame of his successor, the burden was sustained by Julius
Frontinus, a man of high courage. Overcoming at once the
spirit of the enemy and the difficulties of the country, he
subjugated the warlike and powerful nation of the Silures.</p>

<p>14. To him succeeded Agricola, who not only maintained
the peace of the province; but for seven years carried on
war against the Caledonians and their warlike king Galgacus.
He thus added to the Roman empire nations hitherto
unknown.</p>

<p>15. But Domitian, envying the superior glory of Agricola,
recalled him, and sent his lieutenant Lucullus into Britain,
because he had suffered lances of a new form to be named
<i>Luculleas</i> after him.</p>

<p>16. His successor was Trebellius, under whom the two
provinces, namely, Vespasiana and M&aelig;ata, were wrested
from the Roman government; for the Romans gave themselves
up to luxury.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span></p>

<p>17. About this time the emperor Hadrian visiting this
island, erected a wall justly wonderful, and left Julius
Severus his deputy in Britain.</p>

<p>18. From this time nothing worthy of attention is related,
until Antoninus Pius carried on so many wars by his generals.
He conquered the Britons by means of Lollius Urbicus,
the propr&aelig;tor, and Saturninus, prefect of the fleet, and,
the barbarians being driven back, another wall was built.
He recovered the province afterwards called Valentia.</p>

<p>19. Pius dying, Aurelius Antoninus gained many victories
over the Britons and Germans.</p>

<p>20. On the death of Antoninus, when the Romans deemed
their acquisitions insufficient, they suffered a great defeat
under Marcellus.</p>

<p>21. To him succeeded Pertinax, who conducted himself as
an able general.</p>

<p>22. The next was Clodius Albinus, who contended with
Severus for the sceptre and purple.</p>

<p>23. After these, the first who enjoyed the title of lieutenant
was Virius Lupus: he did not perform many splendid
actions; for his glory was intercepted by the unconquerable
Severus, who, having rapidly put the enemy to flight, repaired
the wall of Hadrian, now become ruinous, and restored
it to its former perfection. Had he lived, he intended to
extirpate the very name of the barbarians; but he died by
the visitation of God, among the Brigantes, in the city of
Eboracum.</p>

<p>24. Alexander succeeded, who gained some victories in
the East, and died at Edessa.</p>

<p>25. His successors were the lieutenants Lucilianus, M.
Furius, N. Philippus *********, who, if we except the
preservation of the boundaries, performed hardly any thing
worthy of notice.</p>

<p>26. Afterwards</p>

<h3>COMMENTARY ON THE ITINERARY.</h3>


<p>No people are so barbarous as to be totally destitute of the means of internal
communication; and in proportion as they become more civilized and
have more intercourse with other nations, these means are augmented and
facilitated. By the early accounts of the Britons it appears that they
maintained a considerable foreign commerce, that they had formed towns
or large communities, and used chariots for warlike, and undoubtedly for
civil purposes. Hence it is evident that their internal communications
must have been free and numerous. We need not therefore be surprised, if,
after the lapse of so many centuries, marks of such British roads appear
even at present to a careful observer, differing in many respects from the
roads subsequently made by the Romans, and traversing the island in every
direction.</p>

<p>These ancient ways may be distinguished from those made by the Romans
by unequivocal marks.</p>

<p>I. They are not raised nor paved, nor always straight; but often wind
along the tops or sides of the chains of hills which lie in their course.</p>

<p>II. They do not lead to Roman towns, or notice such towns, except when
placed on the sites of British fortresses.</p>

<p>III. They are attended by tumuli like those of the Romans; but
usually throw out branches, which, after running parallel for some miles,
are reunited to the original stem.</p>

<p>When the Romans obtained a footing in this island, they directed all
their operations, according to their practice, by military principles. They
civilized indeed as they conquered, but conquest was their principal object.
Hence, as each tribe was successively subdued, they fortified such primary
posts as were best adapted to support their future operations, established
secondary posts to secure their communications, and connected the whole
by military ways. From local circumstances, and the principles of war,
their primary posts were either at or near the sites of the British towns, or
on the principal rivers. If therefore the British towns and trackways were
suited to their purposes, they adopted them; if not, they constructed
others. But both their towns and roads differed materially from those of
the original inhabitants. The Romans in their towns or fortresses followed
the system of their own castrametation, in like manner as in modern warfare
the construction of permanent and temporary works is guided by the
same general principles. These towns are of a regular figure, bounded by
lines as straight as the shape of the ground will permit, generally square or
oblong, and consisting commonly in a single wall and ditch, unless in positions
peculiarly dangerous, or where local circumstances rendered additional
defences necessary. On the contrary the British towns, which were occupied
by the Romans, although irregularly shaped, still partake of their
original figure.</p>

<p>Specimens of the first kind, or perfect Roman towns, may be seen in
Colchester, Winchester, Caerleon, Caerwent, Castor near Norwich, and all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
the military stations bordering on the wall of Severus. Of the latter, in
Bath, Silchester, Kentchester, Canterbury, and other places.</p>

<p>Similar marks of difference between the original British trackways and
the Roman roads appear in the Foss, and the Iknield Street;&mdash;the latter,
during the greater part of its course, keeping along the chain of hills which
lay in its way, not leading decidedly to Roman towns, throwing out parallel
branches, attended always with tumuli, still bearing its British name, and
appearing from its direction to have been made for commercial purposes.</p>

<p>On the other hand the adopted roads, but more especially those made by
the Romans themselves, are distinguished by peculiar marks. Posts or
towns are placed on them at nearly regular distances, seldom exceeding
twenty miles, the length of a single march, and also at the point where two
roads intersect each other, or where several roads diverge. These roads
are elevated with surprising labour to the height of ten feet, and sometimes
even more, instances of which may be seen on the heath near Woodyates
Inn in Dorsetshire, near Old Sarum on the side of Ford, in Chute
Park, Wilts, between Ancaster and Lincoln, and still more remarkably on
Bramham Moor, near Tadcaster in Yorkshire. They were formed of materials
often brought from a considerable distance, such as chalk, pebbles, or
gravel; and the most considerable are paved with stones, which are visible
to this day. Tumuli also, which seem to have been the direction-posts of
antiquity, attended their course, and occur in almost every instance where
a road descends a hill, approaches a station, or throws off a branch.
Another peculiarity of the Roman ways is their straight direction, from
which they seldom deviate, except to avoid a rapid ascent or descent, to
throw off another road, or to approach a station, which, from the circumstances
before mentioned, had been fixed out of the general line. Of this
there is a curious instance where the Foss, in approaching Cirencester from
the north, meets the Akeman Street, bearing to the same point from the
north-east, and evidently bends out of its course to join and enter the station
with it.</p>

<p>Of many of the Roman roads, not only in England, but in the greater
part of the Roman empire, an account has been preserved under the name
of the Itinerary of Antoninus, which specifies the towns or stations on
each road, and shows the distances between them. This record was long
supposed to be a public directory or guide for the march of soldiers; but
if this were the case, it is extremely confused and imperfect. It often omits
in one <i>Iter</i> or journey towns which are directly in its course, and yet specifies
them in another, as may be seen in the first, second, sixth, and eighth
Iters. It traces the same road more than once, and passes unnoticed some
of the most remarkable roads in the island, namely a great part of the
Foss, and the whole of the <i>Via Devana</i> (a road from Colchester to Chester.)
Hence this Itinerary has been more justly considered as the heads of a
journal formed by some traveller or officer, who visited the different parts
of the empire from business or duty; and, as Mr. Reynolds conjectures
with great appearance of probability, in the suite of the emperor Adrian.
In this light it may be considered as copious, and the advantages which it
has afforded to the antiquary will be gratefully and universally acknowledged.
Still, however, from the incoherence which appears in that part
relating to our island, and from the mutilated copies which have been
found, there is reason to imagine that the whole of this interesting record
has not escaped the ravages of time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span></p>

<p>Such an itinerary, but varying in many respects from that of Antonine,
is one of the most important parts of the work now presented to the
reader.</p>

<p>In fixing the sites of the towns specified in these Itineraries, our antiquaries
have assumed the most unjustifiable latitude. The mere resemblance
of a name was considered as a reason sufficient to outweigh all
others; even the great Camden suffered himself to be misled by this resemblance,
in fixing Ariconium at Kentchester, Camalodunum at Maldon,
Bennavenna at Bensford, Pons &AElig;lii at Pont Eland, and Ad-Pontem at
Paunton. The explanation of the names to suit the supposed situation
has been another fruitful source of error; not only British and Latin, but
Saxon, Greek, and even Hebrew, have been exhausted to discover significant
appellations; and where one language was not sufficient, half a word
has been borrowed from one language and half from another to support
a favourite hypothesis.<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a> The commentary now presented to the reader is
founded on the following principles.</p>

<p>I. The vestiges of roads actually existing are taken as much as possible
for guides; and the extremes or direction of each Iter, ascertained from
two or more undoubted stations, or other unequivocal proofs.</p>

<p>II. In general, no place is regarded as the site of a Roman station,
unless fixed Roman remains, such as buildings, baths, &amp;c. are found at or
near it; and unless it is situated on or near the line of a Roman road.</p>

<p>III. An exception has, however, been sometimes unavoidably made to
this rule. After the Romans had established their power, and completed
their system of internal communication, they undoubtedly lessened the
number of their garrisons, to avoid either too great a division of their force,
or to reduce that part of it which was necessarily stationary. Hence we
have sometimes considered the direction of the road, and the general distance,
as sufficient data for determining a station or stations, either when they
were situated between two considerable fortified points, or when covered
by others on every side; because it is probable such posts were merely temporary,
and were dilapidated or demolished, even before the decline of the
Roman power.</p>

<p>IV. In assigning a specific Roman name to a place, it has not been
deemed sufficient that fixed antiquities or other equivalent evidence prove a
town to have existed on the spot, unless the order of the names, and the
distances marked in the Itinerary, justify the appellation.</p>

<p>V. Where the line of the Roman road is tolerably perfect, no station is
sought far from it, except where the excess of the Itinerary over the real
distance, or accurate measurement, affords sufficient authority for the
deviation.</p>

<p>VI. The numbers which determine the distances being written in Roman
numerals, which gave great latitude for error<a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a> and substitutions, recourse
has been had to this rule.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span></p><p>Where the road still exists, the whole intermediate space between two
stations already determined, has been examined to discover what places,
from their relative distance, from their site, or the antiquities found in them,
have the fairest claim to be considered as Roman posts; and to such
places the names have been affixed according to the evidence afforded in
the Itinerary.</p>

<p>After this development of the principles on which we have proceeded in
our examination, it is necessary to add a few observations on the Roman
mile, the standard of measurement used in compiling the Itineraries; because
many difficulties in determining the stations arise from our uncertainty
respecting its real length. It may indeed appear easy to ascertain this
point, by a careful measurement of the space between two military columns,
still existing on any known Roman road. But in Britain such an experiment
has been hitherto impracticable; for the columns in our island
have been so universally defaced or removed, that, far from two existing on
the same road, only one has been found<a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> whose original station is known
with any degree of certainty. In France and Italy many of these columns
still exist, and Danville has adduced three instances in Languedoc, in which
the distances between them accurately measured amounted in one to 756,
in another to 753, and in a third to 752 toises and two feet. The average
754 toises and two feet, seems to determine the length of the Roman mile
with sufficient precision; and the result is confirmed by a comparison with
the Roman foot, still preserved in the capitol; for the exact length of the
miles between the military columns on the Appian way, in the neighbourhood
of Rome, as measured by Bianchini, was 5010 of these Roman feet,
which reduced to toises is 756 toises four feet and a half. From these
results Danville estimates the Roman mile at 755 toises, or 1593 yards<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a>
English measure.</p>

<p>Unfortunately this mensuration does not lessen the difficulties of the
English antiquary; for the distance between any two of our known stations,
if measured by this standard, disagrees in almost every instance with the
numbers of the Itineraries. Different conjectures have been advanced to
solve this difficulty. One, supported by the respectable authority of
Horsley, is, that the Romans measured only the horizontal distance, without
regarding the inequalities of the surface; or that the space between station
and station was ascertained from maps accurately constructed. This idea
receives some support from a fact acknowledged by every British antiquary,
namely, that the Itinerary miles bear a regular proportion to the English
miles on plains, but fall short of them in hilly grounds. Another opinion
is, that the Itinerary miles were not measured by an invariable standard,
but in the distant provinces were derived from the common measures of the
country. In support of this conjecture a supposed coincidence between the
computed and measured miles, noticed by Horsley and others, has been
adduced; but if this were the case, there would not be so exact a conformity
between the miles of France and Italy as appears in the instance
before mentioned.</p>

<p>To remove, however, as many causes of error as possible, considerable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
pains have been taken to correct the numbers, by a comparison of all the
earliest and most authentic copies of the Itinerary. These are: The
Itinerary of Talbot, published in Leland's works. That of Camden. Two
copies by Harrison, published first in Hollingshed, and republished by
Burton. That of Gale. That of Surita, who collated five copies, four of
which he thus designates:&mdash;1. Bibliothec&aelig; Regi&aelig; ad D. Laurent. vetustisa.
Codex Ovetensis &AElig;ra I&#390;&#390;CCCCXX descriptus. 2. Bibliothec&aelig; Blandini&aelig;
pervetustus codex a CCCC. circiter annis transcriptus. 3. Bibliothec&aelig;
Neapolitanorum Regum qui post cardinalis de Ursinis fuit anno
M.CCCCXXVII. exscriptus. 4. Christophori Longolii exemplar ab H.
Stephano. Parisiis editum, anno M.I&#390;XII.</p>

<p>As the Roman posts and roads were in a great degree connected with,
or derived from, the British towns and trackways, we proceed to trace first
the course of the British roads which still exist, and to specify the towns
whose sites are known, premising that of the ninety-two capital towns of
the Britons commemorated by historians, the names of only eighty-eight
have been preserved.</p>

<p>The British ways were,&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The <span class="smcap">Watling Street</span>, or Irish road, in two branches, northern and
southern.</p>

<p>2. The <span class="smcap">Iknield Street</span>, or road of the Iceni, the inhabitants of the
eastern coast.</p>

<p>3. The <span class="smcap">Ryknield Street</span>, leading through the country of the Upper
Iceni or Coritani.</p>

<p>4. The <span class="smcap">Ermyn Street</span>, leading from the coast of Sussex to the south-east
part of Scotland.</p>

<p>5. The <span class="smcap">Akeman Street</span>, or intermediate road between the Iknield and
Ryknield Street.</p>

<p>6. The <span class="smcap">Upper Salt-way</span>, leading from the salt-mines at Droitwich to
the coast of Lincolnshire.</p>

<p>7. The <span class="smcap">Lower Salt-way</span>, leading from the same mines to the south
eastern coast.</p>

<p>8. A road which appears to have skirted the western coast, as the Ermyn
Street did the eastern.</p>

<p>Besides these, there is reason to conjecture from several detached pieces,
that another road followed the shores round the island.</p>


<h4>WATLING STREET.</h4>

<p>The south-eastern branch of the Watling Street proceeded from Richborough
on the coast of Kent, to Canterbury; and from thence, nearly in
the line of the present turnpike, towards Rochester. It left that city to
the right, passed the Medway by a ford, and ran almost straight, through
lord Darnley's park, to Southfleet. It bent to the left to avoid the
marshes near London, continued along a road now lost to Holwood Hill,
the capital of the Rhemi, and then followed the course of the present road
to London.&mdash;Having crossed the Thames, it ran by Edgeware to Verulam;
and from thence, with the present great Irish road, through Dunstable and
Towcester to Weedon. Hence, instead of bending to the left, with the
present turnpike, it proceeded straight by Dovebridge, High Cross, Fazeley,
Wall, and Wellington, to Wroxeter. It then passed the Severn, and continued
by Rowton, Pen y Pont, and Bala, to Tommen y Mawr, where it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>
divided into two branches. One ran by Beth Gellert to Caernarvon and
Anglesea, the other by Dolwyddelan, through the mountains to the banks
of the Menai, where it joined the north-eastern branch (which will be presently
described), and ended at Holy Head, the great port of the Irish.</p>

<p>In its course are the British towns <i>Rhutupis</i>, Richborough, <i>Durovernum</i>,
Canterbury, <i>Durobriv&aelig;</i>, Rochester, <i>Noviomagus</i>, Holwood Hill, <i>Trinobantum</i>,
London, <i>Verolamium</i>, St. Alban's, <i>Durocobriv&aelig;</i>, Dunstable, <i>Uriconium</i>,
Wroxeter, <i>Mediolanum</i> on the banks of the Tanad, <i>Segontium</i>, Caer
Segont, and possibly a town, of which the name is lost, at Holy Head.</p>

<p>The north-western branch of the Watling Street, coming from the interior
of Scotland by Cramond and Jedburgh, enters England at Chew Green, and
continues by Riechester to Corbridge. There, crossing the Tyne, it ran
through Ebchester, Lanchester, and Binchester, and passed the Tees by a
ford near Pierce Bridge. Hence it went by Catteric, Newton, Masham,
and Kirby Malside to Ilkley, and near Halifax to Manchester. Over the
moors between these two last places it is called the Devil's Causeway.
From Manchester, where it passed the Mersey, it proceeded by Street,
Northwich, Chester, Caerhun, and over the mountains to Aber, where it
fell into the south-western branch, in its course to Holy Head.</p>

<p>On it were the British towns, <i>Bremenium</i>, Riechester, <i>Epiacum</i>, Lanchester,
<i>Vinovium</i>, Binchester, <i>Cutaractonis</i>, Catterick, <i>Olicana</i>, Ilkley,
and <i>Deva</i>, Chester.</p>


<h4>THE IKNIELD STREET,</h4>

<p>Or road of the Iceni, proceeds from the coast near Great Yarmouth.
Passing through Taesborough, it runs by Icklingham and Newmarket, and,
skirting the chain of hills which stretches through Cambridgeshire, Bedfordshire,
Buckinghamshire, and Oxfordshire, continues by Bournbridge to
Icoldon and Royston (where it intersects the Ermyn Street). Thence it
proceeds by Baldock, over Wilbury Hill, to Dunstable (where it crosses
the Watling Street), Tring, Wendover, Elsborough, near Risborough
Chinor, Watlington, Woodcote, and Goring, and, passing the Thames at
Streetly, throws off a collateral branch, which will be noticed under the
name of the <span class="smcap">Ridgeway</span>. From hence it proceeded, as Stukeley imagined,
by Aldworth, Newbury Street, Ashmansworth, Tangley, and Tidworth, to
Old Sarum. Thence by the two Stratfords, across Vernditch Chase,
Woodyates Inn, the Gussages, Badbury, Shapwick, Shitterton, Maiden
Castle, Eggardon, Bridport, Axminster, Honiton, Exeter, Totness, &amp;c., to
the Land's End.</p>

<p>The collateral branch called the <span class="smcap">Ridgeway</span>, ran from Streetly along the
hills, by Cuckhamsley Hill, Whitehorse Hill, and Ashbury, towards Abury,
from whence its course is unknown. Possibly it ran towards Glastonbury.
From Elworthy barrows, above Taunton, it passes south-westerley into
Devonshire, and from Stretton in Cornwall, it kept along the ridge of hills
to Redruth and the Land's End.</p>

<p>The British towns on this way were <i>Ad Taum</i>, Taesborough, the ancient
capital of the Iceni Magni, <i>Durocobriv&aelig;</i>, Dunstable, <i>Sorbiodunum</i>, Old
Sarum, <i>Durinum</i>, probably Maiden Castle, <i>Isca</i>, Exeter, <i>Tamara</i>, a post
on the Tamar, <i>Voluba</i> on the Fowey, and <i>Cenia</i> on the Fal.</p>

<p>On the Ridgeway, possibly <i>Avalonia</i>, Glastonbury, <i>Termolus</i>, by some
supposed to be Molland in Devon, <i>Artavia</i>, ... <i>Musidum</i>, near
Stratton, and <i>Halangium</i>, Carnbre.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span></p>


<h4>RYKNIELD STREET,</h4>

<p>Or street of the upper Iceni, said to begin at the mouth of the Tyne, ran
by Chester le Street to Binchester, where it joined the Watling Street, and
continued with it to Catterick. Then, bearing more easterly, it ran with
the present great northern road to within two miles of Borough Bridge,
where it left the turnpike to the right, and crossed the Eure to Aldborough.
From thence it went by Coptgrave, Ribston, Spofforth, through Stokeld
Park, to Thorner, Medley, Foleby, Bolton, Graesborough, Holme, Great
Brook near Tretown, Chesterfield, Alfreton, Little Chester, Egginton, to
Burton, and Wall (where it crossed the Watling Street). Thence through
Sutton Colefield, to Birmingham, King's Norton, Alchester, Bitford, Sedgebarrow,
Tewkesbury, Glocester, Lidney, Chepstow, and probably by Abergavenny,
Brecon, Landilo, and Caermarthen to St. David's.</p>

<p>It passed the British towns of <i>Vinovium</i>, Binchester, <i>Cataracton</i>, Catterick,
<i>Isurium</i>, Aldborough, <i>Etocetum</i>, Wall, <i>Alauna</i>, Alcester, <i>Glevum</i>,
Glocester, <i>Maridunum</i>, Caermarthen, and <i>Menapia</i>, St. David's.</p>


<h4>THE ERMYN STREET</h4>

<p>Came from the eastern side of Scotland, and, crossing the Tweed west of
Berwick, ran near Wooler, Hedgely, Brumpton, Brinkburn, Netherwittern,
Hartburn, and Rial, to Corbridge, where it joined the North Watling Street.
Passing with that Way the two great rivers the Tyne and the Tees, it continued
to Catterick, where it divided into two branches.</p>

<p>The western branch went with the Ryknield Street as far as Aldborough,
and then, leaving that way to the right, proceeded by Little Ousebourn, to
Helensford, over Bramham Heath, to Aberford, Castleford, Houghton,
Stapleton, Adwick, Doncaster, Bawtry, and probably by Tuxford, Southwell,
and over the Trent to Thorp (where it passed the Foss), Staunton,
and Stainby, where it joined the</p>

<p>Eastern branch. This branch ran from Catterick by North Allerton,
Thirsk, Easingwold, Stamford Bridge, Market Weighton, and South Cave,
and, crossing the Humber, continued by Wintringham, Lincoln, and
Ancaster, to near Witham, when it was reunited with the western branch
above-mentioned. Both continued to Brig Casterton, near Stamford,
Chesterton, Stilton, Godmanchester, Royston (where it crossed the
Icknield Street), Buntingford, Puckeridge, Ware Park, west of Roxbourn,
Cheshunt, Enfield, Wood Green, and London. Here it again divided into
two branches. The more westerly went by Dorking, Coldharbour, Stone
Street, and Pulborough to Chichester; while the easterly was continued by
Bromley, Holwood Hill, Tunbridge Wells, Wadhurst, Mayfield, and Eastbourn,
to Pevensey.</p>

<p>On it were the British towns <i>Vinovium</i>, Binchester, <i>Cataractonis</i>, Catterick,
<i>Isurium</i>, Aldborough, <i>Lindum</i>, Lincoln, <i>Durnomagus</i>, Castor near
Peterborough, <i>Trinovantum</i>, London, <i>Regentium</i> or <i>Regnum</i>, Chichester,
<i>Noviomagus</i>, Holwood Hill, and <i>Anderida Portus</i>, Pevensey.</p>


<h4>AKEMAN STREET</h4>

<p>Appears to have passed from the eastern side of the island, probably by
Bedford, Newport Pagnel, Stony Stratford, and Buckingham (or as others
think by Fenny Stratford and Winsborough), to Alcester. It then ran by
Kirklington, Woodstock, Stonefield Astall and Coln St. Alwin's, to Ciren<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>cester,
Rodmarton, Cherrington, Bagspath, and Symonds' Hall. From
thence it is said to be continued by Cromehall to Aust, where, passing the
Severn, it probably ran through Caerwent, Caerleon, and along the coast by
Caerdiff, Neath, Lwghor, to Caermarthen, and the Irish port at St. David's.</p>

<p>The British towns were <i>Corinum</i>, Cirencester, <i>Venta Silurum</i>, Caerwent,
<i>Isca</i>, Caerleon, <i>Maridunum</i>, Caermarthen, and <i>Menapia</i>, St. David's.</p>


<h4>THE UPPER SALT-WAY,</h4>

<p>Which appears to have been the communication between the sea coast of
Lincolnshire and the Salt-mines at Droitwich. It is first known as leading
from the neighbourhood of Stainsfield, towards Paunton and Denton, and
then running not far from Saltby and Croxton, is continued straight by
Warmby and Grimston, to Sedgehill on the Foss. Here it appears to bear
towards Barrow on the Soar, and crossing Charnwood Forest, is again seen
at Stretton on the borders of Warwickshire, from whence it is easily traced
to Birmingham and over the Lickey to Droitwich.</p>

<p>British town <i>Salin&aelig;</i>, Droitwich.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Second Salt-way</span> is little known, although the parts here described
have been actually traced. It came from Droitwich, crossed Worcestershire
under the name of the <span class="smcap">Salt-way</span>, appears to have passed the Avon,
somewhere below Evesham, tended towards the chain of hills above Sudeley
Castle, where it is still visible, attended by <i>tumuli</i> as it runs by Hawling.
Thence it proceeds to Northleach, where it crossed the Foss, in its way to
Coln St. Aldwin's, on the Akeman Street, and led to the sea coast of
Hampshire.</p>

<p><i>Venta Belgarum</i>, Winchester, and <i>Portus Magnus</i>, Porchester, or
<i>Clausentum</i>, Bittern near Southampton&mdash;were probably situated in its
course.</p>

<p>In many places are vestiges of a continued road skirting the western side
of the island, in the same manner as the Ermyn Street did the eastern, of
which parts were never adopted by the Romans. There is great reason to
suppose it British, because it connects many of the British towns. It
appears to have commenced on the coast of Devon, perhaps not far from
the mouth of the Ex, and to have gone by Exeter, Taunton, Bridgewater,
Bristol, Glocester, Kidderminster, Claverley, Weston, High Offley, Betley,
Middlewich, Northwich, Warrington, Preston, Lancaster. Here probably
dividing into two branches, one ran by Kendal, Penrith, and Carlisle, to
the extreme parts of the island, while the other passed, by Kirby Lonsdale
and Orton, to Kirby Thure, from whence it continued under the name of
the <span class="smcap">Maiden-way</span>, by the Wall and Bewcastle into the interior parts of
Scotland. On this Street were <i>Isca</i>, Exeter, <i>Uxella</i>, possibly near Bridgewater,
<i>Glevum</i>, Gloucester, <i>Brannogenium</i>, Worcester, <i>Salin&aelig;</i>, Droitwich,
<i>Coccium</i>, Blackrode, and <i>Luguballium</i>, Carlisle.</p>

<p>Besides these, and the separate communications between the different
towns, there is reason to imagine that a general road ran round the whole
coast of the island, parts of which have been observed near the southern
coast of Dorsetshire, particularly from Abbotsbury to the isle of Purbeck;
likewise in Hampshire, along Portsdown Hill; and from Old Winchester
through Sussex, on the tops of the hills between Midhurst and Chichester,
to Arundel and Brighthelmstone. Also in Essex from Maldon to Colchester,
and in Suffolk by Stretford, Ipswich, Stretford, and Blythburgh, to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>
banks of the Yar. In Lincolnshire are two branches, one running clearly
from Tattersal, by Horncastle, Ludford, Strinton, Caistor, and Somerby,
and a second nearer to the coast from Lowth towards Brocklesby, and both
tending to the passage of the Humber, not far from Barton. Also along
the principal part of the coast through Yorkshire, Durham, and Northumberland.
On the western side of the island it appears to have passed on
the hills which skirt the northern coast of Devonshire and Somersetshire,
and possibly might be traced through Wales and towards Scotland.</p>

<p>The first Iter having run uniformly on the traces of the British road
called Watling Street (except the small distance from Southfleet to London),
and the road remaining tolerably perfect, there can be little difficulty
in fixing the several stations, or indeed in correcting the sometimes corrupted
numbers of the Itinerary. It begins at Richborough, and, although at
present obscure from the improved cultivation of the country, may be easily
traced to Canterbury, from whence it went in the direction of the present
turnpike to Rochester, leaving the intermediate station at Stone Chaple, in
Ospringe, a little to the left hand. At Rochester it passed the Medway,
considerably above the present bridge, and instead of running to the right
with the modern turnpike, it went as straight as the nature of the ground
would permit, by Cobham Park, and Shinglewell, to Barkfields, in Southfleet
(the station <i>Vagniacis</i> in Antonine,) then to Swanscombe Parkwood,
through which it passed, and rejoined the Dover road between the fifteenth
and sixteenth milestone, near Dartford Brent. Hence it went by Shooter's
Hill over the Thames to London; and then as before mentioned, by the
site of Mr. Napier's house at Brockley Hill, Verulam, Dunstable, Fenny
Stratford, Towcester, Burnt Walls,<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a> near Lilbourne, High Cross, Manceter,
Wall, Okenyate, to Wroxeter. Here, quitting the south-west branch
of the Watling Street, it bore to the right by Uffington, Broughton, Overley,
Hammer, and Sarn Bridge to Banchor; and from thence ran clearly
by Stockach and Aldford, over the Dee to Chester.</p>

<p>The Roman road here joining the North-east Watling Street, before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>
mentioned, continued with it to Bodfari, and crossing Denbighshire, went
over the Conway to Caer H&ucirc;n; and is supposed to have run as straight as
the country would permit, to Caer Segont, about half a mile south of Caernarvon.</p>

<p>This Iter runs on a branch of the South-east Watling Street, from Caer
Segont, nearly in the direction of the present road to Tommen y Mur, an
undoubted station in the parish of Maentrwg, by the common name of
Sarn Helen, or the "paved way of the Legion." From hence it is continued
to Bala; and on the banks of the Tanad, not far from the point
where it is intersected by the Roman road from Caersws to Chester, was
probably the lost town of <i>Mediolanum</i>. From <i>Mediolanum</i> the road runs
under the north end of the Brythen, straight, although obscurely, to Rowton,
and from thence over the Severn to Wroxeter.</p>

<p>As it is fifty-one measured miles from London to Colchester, and as it
is probable that the stone from whence the Roman miles were measured
was at least one mile west of Whitechapel church, we cannot allow any
material deviation from the course of the present road, except in the
neighbourhood of the capital, where the Roman road, instead of passing
through Mile End, went much straighter over the Lee at Old Ford, and
fell again into the course of the present turnpike at Stratford. The Itinerary
allowing only fifty-two miles between London and Colchester, and the
fifth Iter of Antonine agreeing with this of Richard, by stating twenty-eight
as the distance between London and <i>C&aelig;saromagus</i>, we may implicitly
adopt the distances here given, and fix the intermediate stations near Rumford,
Chelmsford, and Kelvedon. From Colchester the road ran to the
Stour, where probably stood the Mansio <i>ad Ansam</i>. From hence to Castor,
near Norwich, (the <i>Venta Icenorum</i>,) the stations and course of the
road are unknown. Some commentators have supposed it ran westerly, by
Brettenham and Thetford; others by Ipswich, Stowmarket, and Scole
Inn; and others have carried it more easterly, by Ipswich and Blythburgh,
or Dunwich, to the capital of the Iceni. In favour of the first, there is
merely the supposed resemblance of the name of Brettenham to <i>Cambretonium</i>;
of the second, traces of a Roman way, called the Pye Road; and
of the third, a British track-way, and another Roman road, called the
Stone Street. But the distances suit none of these sites, and no Roman
remains have any where been found, between the Stour and Castor, sufficient
to justify an alteration of the numerals.</p>

<p><i>Icianis</i> may have been Icklingham; and <i>Camboricum</i> was most probably
at Cambridge, from whence there is a Roman road discoverable to
Lincoln. To the first station, Godmanchester, this Iter goes on the great
communication between Colchester and Chester, which for the sake of distinction
may be called the <i>Via Devana</i>; and from Godmanchester to Lincoln,
on the eastern branch of the Ermyn Street, which was adopted by
the Romans. Twenty miles from Godmanchester, we find the great station
of Chesterton, on one side of the Nen, and Castor on the other; which
probably gave rise to the two names of <i>Durobriv&aelig;</i>, and <i>Durnomagus</i>, the
Roman and British towns severally noticed by Antonine and Richard.
About twenty-five miles further, in the course of the road which cannot be
mistaken, we find Ancaster, the <i>Isinnis</i>, <i>Corisennis</i>, or <i>Causennis</i> of the
Itineraries, from whence twenty-one additional miles bring us to Lincoln.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span></p>

<p>The fourth Iter left Lincoln with the Eastern Ermyn Street, which ran
to the Humber; and, after continuing on it about five miles, turned suddenly
to the left, pursuing its course in a straight line to the Trent, which
it passed immediately opposite to the station of Littleborough. The Roman
road may be traced from hence to Austerfield and Doncaster, where
it fell in with the Western Ermyn Street, and is visible all the way by
Castleford, Aberford, and Tadcaster, to York. In this Iter, the station of
Tadcaster is passed unnoticed, as in the former the station of Brig Casterton,
near Stamford.</p>

<p>From York the Iter is continued along the left bank of the Ouse, till it
crossed the river to Aldborough. From hence rejoining the Western
Ermyn Street, it passed the Eure, and ran straight through Catterick to the
Tees, which it crossed at Piercebridge. It continued by the Royal Oak,
St. Andrew Aukland, and the Bishop's Park, to Binchester, where, after
fording the Were, it went with the North Watling Street to Lanchester;
and, without noticing either Ebchester or Corbridge, over the Tyne to Halton
Chester on the Wall. Here separating from the North Watling Street,
it ran with the Ermyn Street, now known in Northumberland by the name
of the Devil's Causeway, to the bank of the Coquet and the Tweed, and
entering Scotland on the East, was continued to the wall of Antonine.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span></p>

<p>In regard to the part of the country traversed by this Iter, there appears
to have been so little connection between the work of our author and the
map which accompanies it, that we can rely little on the latter either to
assist or correct us. This Iter is made to begin from <i>Curia</i>, a town probably
on the confines of some petty kingdom, and to pass to the first certain
post of <i>Bremenium</i>, or Riechester. Now, on referring to the map, <i>Curia</i>,
the principal town of the Gadeni, so far from lying on the road which leads
to <i>Bremenium</i>, the capital of the Ottadini, is considerably to the westward
of its course. From this disagreement, commentators have suspected a
mistake of the transcriber, and imagine that <i>Curia</i> is intended for <i>Corium</i>.
It is certain, at least, that this Iter, running on the east side of the island,
on the track of the Northern Watling Street, enters Northumberland at
Chew Green, goes from thence to Riechester (leaving unnoticed the station
at Risingham), and runs with it to Corbridge, Ebchester, Binchester, Catterick,
and York.</p>

<p>From York to Flamborough Head, a Roman road may still be traced;
and as the distance agrees with the Itinerary, and there must have been a
Roman post on or near that headland, we should think it more probable
that this was the site of <i>Pr&aelig;turium</i>,[D] although we have not yet discovered
the remains of any post on the Derwent, or the intermediate station of
<i>Delgovicia</i>. So many Roman roads from different quarters point towards
Stamford bridge, that there is no doubt the station of <i>Derventio</i> was
near it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span></p>

<p>Such appears to be the incorrectness of the numerals attached to this
Iter, as well as to the corresponding Iter of Antonine, that, although four
of the six stations are well known, and a fifth can scarcely be mistaken,
yet, we can in no other way obviate the difficulty than by supposing a station
omitted, or by altering the numerals, none of which, except the first, agree
with the distances between the vestiges of the different stations and their
supposed sites; for example, in the first part between York and Manchester,
where the Itinerary gives only 49 miles, the nearest road through
Heathersfield amounts to 65.</p>

<p>As the only great and undoubted Roman station between Tadcaster and
Manchester is at Slack (for the camps at Kirklees, and Castleshaw, are
only temporary posts), it will perhaps be justifiable to fix this point as the
site of <i>Cambodunum</i>; to suppose ten miles omitted in this stage; and in
the next to conjecture that, by a common error in copying the Roman
numerals, XVIII. has been substituted for XXIII. the exact distance from
Slack to Manchester.</p>

<p>As the Mersey was undoubtedly the boundary on the West between the
Roman provinces of Maxima and Flavia, and as the Roman road still
existing crossed it at Stretford, we fix the next point there, and change the
number XVII. to VI. The two next stations of <i>Condate</i> and <i>Deva</i>, the
numerals (with a slight alteration) permit us to fix at Kinderton and
Chester. It is worthy of remark, that with these alterations the sum total
of the numerals remains nearly the same.</p>

<p>The road from York to Catterick has been traced before, and the Roman
way from thence to Carlisle ran nearly in the direction of the present turnpike.
The only doubt which occurs, therefore, in this Iter, is whether,
from a similarity of sound, the transcriber of Richard has not erroneously
written Brocavonacis for Brovonacis, which are two neighbouring posts in
this direction, the first Brougham, and the second Kirby Thur. As the
conjecture is not improbable, the corrected distance is given from the
latter.</p>

<p>It is worthy of observation that in this Iter four successive V's have
been added by mistake of the transcriber, as is the case in regard to the
X's omitted in the third Iter.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span></p><p>Innumerable difficulties occur on every side in endeavouring to explain
this Iter. There is great reason to believe that the <i>Trimontium</i> of this
Iter was Birrenswork Hill, and that the road ran from thence along the
western side of the island as it is traced in the map of Richard. Camelon
is allowed by all antiquaries to be the <i>Ad Vallum</i>: but it is impossible to
draw the line between these two points; for although General Roy has
mentioned a road from Carlisle on the eastern side of the Eildon Hills, and
another on the western beyond Cleghorn to Castle Cary, there is little
authority for the existence of either. Lynekirk has every appearance of a
station, lay within the territories of the Gadeni, and would suit the situation
assigned to <i>Gadanica</i>, but no road has hitherto been discovered leading to
or from it. If the western trended at Biggar as much to the east, as that
part which remains in the direction of Glasgow does to the west, it would
have passed Borthwich Castle or the Gore, which Roy supposes was the
<i>Corium</i>. Admitting the identity of this station would clear up the whole
of this Iter to the Wall. There is no doubt that the sites of <i>Lindum</i>,
<i>Victoria</i>, and <i>Ad Hiernam</i> were at Ardoch, Dealgin Ross, and Strageth.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the difficulties which occur in tracing this Iter from
Carlisle to the Wall, yet from thence to the Tay the direction of the road,
and the situation of the stations as fixed by General Roy agree so perfectly
with the Itinerary, as to leave no doubt that he has ascertained their real
position. But although he discovered a road north of the Tay, yet, as he
found no vestiges of stations, Mr. Chalmers seems to have been more
successful in fixing the posts between that river and <i>Ptoroton</i>.</p>

<p>It does not appear that the road was ever completed: however, from
<i>Orrea</i> on the Tay, a little above Perth, he observes, that the communication
ran through the passage of the Sidlaw Hills, and along the Carse of Gowrie
to the north end of the estuary of the Tay near Dundee; two miles west
of which place, and half a mile north of Invergowrie, are the remains of a
Roman camp about two hundred yards square, fortified with a high
rampart and spacious ditch. Here he places <i>Ad Tavum</i>. Proceeding
hence north-easterly through the natural opening of the country, and
passing in the way the camp at Harefaulds, at the distance of twenty-three
miles is Brechin on the South Esk, the station <i>Ad &AElig;sicam</i>, exactly in the
line laid down in Richard's map, and at the distance given in the Itinerary.
Continuing from the South Esk in a north-north-easterly direction, at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>
distance of five miles and a half, we reach the North Esk, the supposed
<i>Ad Tinam</i>. We pass that river at King's Ford, and proceeding up the
valley of Lutherwater, at the distance of eight miles and a half find
Fordun, where there are the remains of two Roman camps. From thence
proceeding seventeen miles, to the well known camp at Raedikes, and
continuing in a northerly direction six miles beyond, is the rectangular
camp on the Dee at Peter Culter, called Norman Dikes, the <i>Devana</i> of
the Iter. This point is exactly thirty-one miles from Brechin on the South
Esk, agrees with the aggregate distances in the Itinerary <i>Ad Tinam</i> VIII,
and <i>Ad Devanam</i> XXIII, and corresponds with the track delineated on
Richard's map.</p>

<p>The obvious openings through this rugged country point out the way by
which the Romans must have penetrated northerly by the right of Achlea
Fiddy and Kinmundy, to Kintore on the Don. They followed the Strath
to the ford where the high road has always passed to Inverurie, and
proceeded north-north-west through the moorlands, to the sources of the
Ithan, and the camp at Glenmailin, the <i>Ituna</i> of Richard, a distance of
twenty-six miles. From thence proceeding northward, across the Doverna
at Achengoul, where are still considerable remains of military works; and
at the distance of thirteen miles, we reach the high ground north of Foggy
lone, at the east side of Knock Hill, the <i>Mons Grampius</i> of the Iter.</p>

<p>Hence the road runs to <i>Ad Selinam</i>, which is supposed to be on the
Cullen, near the old Tower of Deskford, at the distance of ten miles.
Following the course of the river, and the coast of the Murray Frith,
seventeen miles, we arrive at the Roman post of <i>Tuessis</i>, on the high bank
of the Spey, below the church of Bellie. Seventeen miles further is
Burgh Head, the <i>Ptorotone</i> of Richard.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span></p><p>The first part of this Iter is taken from General Roy; and as we have
none of the intermediate stations between Carlisle and the Wall, every
commentator may choose what route he pleases, although none will
coincide with the distances of the Itinerary. From Carlisle, if we place
any reliance on the numbers, the next station, <i>Brocavonavis</i>, can only be
fixed at Brougham. Thence the road to the banks of the Lune, as well as
the station on it, is uncertain; for, whether we choose Overborough or Lancaster,
we know of no road to direct us; and the only reason for preferring
the latter is the supposed site of the next station, <i>Coccium</i>, at Blackrode,
and the course of the road through Lancaster, tending more immediately to
that point, than the road through Overborough. The two next stations,
<i>Mancunium</i> and <i>Condate</i>, as well as the connecting line of road, are well
known. From Kinderton, although there is a Roman way pointing to
Chesterton in Staffordshire, the <i>Mediolanum</i> of this Iter, and the site of
<i>Etocetum</i> is undoubtedly Wall, yet we speak with hesitation of the line of
communication betwixt them; though we presume it ran through Newcastle,
Stone, and Ridgeley. From Wall, which is on the Watling Street,
the Iter continues along the Ryknield Street, through Sutton Colfield Park,
to Birmingham. There falling in with the first Salt-Way, it proceeds to
Droitwich, and is continued by the Western Road, through Worcester to
Gloucester. Here, turning nearly at a right angle, it passes by the well
known Roman road over Birdlip Hill to Cirencester; and trending to the
right, proceeds by the Foss to <i>Aqu&aelig; Solis</i> or Bath. Quitting the Foss, and
still bearing to the right, it continues along the lower road to Wells, and
from thence to <i>Uxella</i>, which was probably at Bridgewater. From the
banks of the Parret it ran in the track of the British Way, and the present
turnpike by Taunton, Wellington, and Collumpton, to Exeter.</p>

<p>As the course of the Roman road connecting the stations of this Iter
is still discernible, we do not hesitate in correcting the imperfections of
Richard by the corresponding Iter of Antonine. At Bitton, six miles from
Bath, we find marks of a post attended with <i>tumuli</i>, which whether called
<i>Abone</i> or <i>Trajectus</i><a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a> is of little importance, because, like the next, Sea
Mills, it will suit either appellation, from its position on the Avon, and
commanding a passage over that river. From Bitton the Roman way ran
nearly in the direction of the present turnpike, north of the river as far as
St. George's church; thence it proceeded straight near St. Paul's; ascended<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
the Downs behind Mr. Daubeney's house to the direction-post, from whence
it crossed Durdham Down, and skirted Mrs. Jackson's park wall to Sea
Mills, a great maritime post at the confluence of the Trim and the Avon.
It continued by Lord De Clifford's house straight to the Severn, crossed that
river, and passed by Caldecot Castle through Caerwent and Caerleon to the
bank of the Taaf and Evenny Park, which last place Roman remains lead
us to conjecture was the site of <i>Bovium</i>. At Neath we have also little
hesitation in fixing the site of <i>Nidus</i>, because a road from the <i>Gaer</i> near
<i>Brecon</i> evidently leads to the same spot.</p>

<p>The remainder of this Iter is obscure. <i>Leucaro</i> has been fixed at
Lwghor, principally from the resemblance of the name. From thence the
road may have run to Caermarthen (<i>Maridunum</i>), which appears to have
been omitted; and was probably continued as straight as the country would
permit to Castel Flemish and St. David's, where we would place the stations
<i>Vigesimum</i> and <i>Menapia</i>.<a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a></p>

<p>As the traces of a Roman road from Bath towards Marlborough are still
visible, we have only to examine in what points of its course remains have
been found sufficient to justify us in determining the sites of the different
stations. Accordingly, at fifteen miles from Bath we have Highfield, in
Sandy Lane, near Heddington; and at fifteen more Folly Farm, near
Marlborough. From hence twenty miles bring us to Spene; and although
at this place few remains have been discovered, yet the direction of another
Roman road, from Cirencester to the same point, sufficiently proves the
existence of a station. Of the site of <i>Calleva</i> at Silchester<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a> there can be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span>
little doubt; although the course of the road from Spene is uncertain. The
road from Silchester, still known by the name of the Devil's Causeway, as
it runs over Bagshot Heath, as well as evident traces of it between Staines
and London, still exist; but the intermediate station of <i>Bibracte</i> is doubtful.
If the numbers in this Iter be correct, we cannot deviate from the
straight line, and this post must be placed near the hill at Egham, or
the head of the Virginia Water.</p>

<p>The beginning of this Iter cannot be traced, notwithstanding two out of

because the distance given from Caerleon to <i>Gobannium</i> or Abergavenny
will not admit of any deviation from the straight line. From Abergavenny,
after passing the Munnow, the Roman road still exists, particularly near
Madley, pointing to Kentchester, and from thence may be traced by the

<p>This Iter ran, like the former, from Caerleon to Usk, where bending to
the right it traversed the country to Monmouth. From hence, although we
cannot trace the exact line of the road, yet we have no doubt that it crossed
the Wye to the next station at Berry Hill, in Weston, under Penyard;
and continued nearly in a direct line to Gloucester. As the author has
only left the name of a river for the next station, it must be placed in such
a situation on the Avon as to admit the distance of fifteen miles from the
next station of Alcester, which was the site of <i>Alauna</i>. This would carry
it to the westward of Evesham. From Alcester, likewise, till we reach the
Foss, we have neither a road nor distance, nor even the name of a station.
For this reason we deem ourselves justified in considering the undoubted
Roman camp at Chesterton on the Foss, as the post omitted by our author,
and from thence we proceed on that known military way to the certain
stations of High Cross, Leicester, Willoughby, Bridgeford, Brough, and
Lincoln.</p>

<p>This Iter leads from London to the south-west part of Hampshire, and
from thence, skirting the Sussex and Kentish coasts, back to the capital.</p>

<p>At the first step the author gives forty-four miles as the distance between
London and Silchester, instead of forty, as in the twelfth Iter; hence we
may deviate a little in settling the site of <i>Bibracte</i> or <i>Ad Pontes</i>. Of the
next station we can merely offer a conjecture. As the country of the Atrebates
and their capital, <i>Calleva</i> or Silchester, is by our author described
as lying near the Thames, in distinction from that of the Segontiaci,<a name="FNanchor_720_720" id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a> whose
capital, <i>Vindomis</i>, was further distant from that river, and nearer the Kennet,
one point only appears to suit the distances, which bears the proper
relation to the neighbouring stations, and at the same time falls at the intersection
of two known Roman roads. This is in the neighbourhood of St.
Mary Bourne, and affords reason for considering Egbury Camp, or some
spot near it, as the capital of the Segontiaci. For by following the Roman
road called the Portway from Silchester, at the distance of fifteen miles is
the rivulet near St. Mary Bourne, and not far from it, the point where the
Portway is intersected by the Roman road from Winchester to Cirencester;
and proceeding along this last we have another distance of twenty-one
miles to Winchester. The road from Winchester by Otterbourne to Stoneham,
and thence by the Green Lane to Bittern, is well known, and the
distance sufficiently exact. But from thence, although traces of the road
are occasionally discoverable on Ridgway, and to the north of Bursledon
Hill, pointing towards Fareham and Portchester, yet the latter part is almost
totally unknown or lost. From Portchester it ran in the track of the present
turnpike to Chichester; and over the Arun not far from Arundel; and
then along the coast to Pevensey, the banks of the Rother, Lymne, Dover,
Richborough, Reculver, and Canterbury. There falling into the track of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>

<p>The exact route from London to Winchester not being defined, we may
suppose that it ran, as before, through Silchester, and from thence by
St. Mary Bourne, as in the 15th Iter. From Winchester, as the road still
exists leading to Old Sarum, the distance of eleven miles will probably
give the site of <i>Brige</i>, although the station itself is not known; and the
nine following will lead us to Old Sarum. Pursuing the course of the
road, which may be still traced quite to Dorchester, remains found on
Gussage Cow Down point out the site of <i>Ventageladia</i>; and the disagreement
between the Itinerary and real distance from thence to Dorchester
justifies us in supposing that some intermediate post has been omitted.
The site of <i>Moridunum</i> is doubtful; some thinking it to be Eggerdon, or
the Hill of the Morini, with which the distance of nine miles would not
disagree; while others, with more reason, prefer Seaton, the great port of
the West, because the Foss leads from Ilchester directly to it. Intermediate
stations have evidently been lost between this place and Exeter, as has also
been the case between that place and the Dart, the Tamar, the Fowey and
the Fal. From Honiton the road is visible pointing to Exeter, as well as
from Exeter to Totness, and according to the ingenious Borlase, even to
Lostwithiel.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span></p>

<p>This Iter ran in the track of the British Ermyn Street, from Pevensey
and East Bourne, which were perhaps the <i>Anderida Portus</i> and <i>Anderida</i>
of the 15th Iter, along the ridge of hills to Holwood Hill (already
mentioned as the capital of the Rhemi), and from thence to London, but
its traces are now so obscure as to be almost forgotten. Some think that
from London it proceeded along the British Street, by the Green Lanes,
Cheshunt, and to the west of Broxbourne to Ware; while others suppose
that this Roman road went much straighter, and nearly in the course of
the present turnpike through Ware to Broughing, a post at the confluence
of the Rib and the Quin, where was probably the station <i>Ad Fines</i>, the
boundary between the countries of the Iceni, the Cassii, and the Trinobantes.
From hence the Roman road is so perfect by Caxton quite to
Lincoln, that we fix the station of <i>Durnomagus</i> at the great camp near
Castor, and the three others at Godmanchester, Ancaster, and Lincoln.
From Lincoln the Roman road proceeds directly to the banks of the Humber,
having, at the distance assigned in the Iter, the <i>Mansio in Medio</i>, and the
post at Winterton; from whence six miles carry us across the river to Brough,
or <i>Petuaria</i>, a post often confounded with the <i>Pr&aelig;torium</i> of the 6th Iter.
As there is a Roman road still existing from Brough towards Weighton,
and then over Barmby Moor to York, there can be little doubt in
considering it as the course of this Iter. Should, however, the forty-six
miles given in the Itinerary (which appears to have been an error arising
from the mistake of the transcriber in confounding <i>Petuaria</i> and
<i>Pr&aelig;torium</i>) be considered as correct, the course of the Iter may be
supposed to have run from Brough by Londesborough and Millington, to
the great road from Flamborough, and then to have turned with it to York,
making exactly the forty-six miles of the Itinerary.</p>

<p>This Iter proceeds from York in the same direction as the fourth to
Castleford, where, bearing to the right to join the Ryknield Street, it
continues with it through the several stations of Temple Brough on the
Don, Chesterfield, Penkridge, Little Chester, and Branston, to Wall.
Here diverging to the left with the Watling Street, it passed through
Manceter, High Cross, and Dove Bridge, to Burnt Walls. It there quitted
the known road, and bore across the country, by an unknown route, to
Alcester, on the Akeman street; but the considerable remains found at
Black Ground, near Chippington Norton, would lead us to place the
station of <i>Brinavis</i> there, if the Roman road did not make any material
deviation between Burnt Walls and Alcester.</p>

<p>From Alcester the road runs plainly over Ottmoor, and indeed almost
all the way to Dorchester. But from thence as we can discover no traces
of a road, and as our next post appears to have been only six miles distant
and on the Thames, if any reliance can be placed on the number, it may
be the point where the Roman road from Wantage apparently passes that
river opposite Mongewell. The next distance of fifteen miles, being
insufficient to lead us by any road to <i>Vindomis</i>, if it were placed either at
Silchester or near St. Mary Bourne, it is more than probable that there is
some error in the name of the station; and as the following number of
forty-six miles agrees with the distance in the 15th Iter of the road from
Silchester passing near Egbury to Bittern, we cannot help supposing that
the name of <i>Vindomis</i> has been inserted by mistake for that of <i>Calleva</i>.</p>

pieces as that of <i>Calleva Atrebatum</i>. It has been placed at Silchester,
Henley, Wallingford, and Reading, by different antiquaries; yet in no
doubtful case do more testimonies concur to ascertain the site. It was
evidently a station of importance, because it appears as a central point, to
which the roads traversed by three different Iters of Antonine (the 13th,
14th, and 15th,) converge. It was the capital of the Atrebates; situated
at known distances from London, Winchester, Bath, Spene, and Caerleon;
and at a doubtful one, though easily supplied, from Cirencester and Old
Sarum. These circumstances cannot by any expedient be brought to coincide,
either with Henley, Wallingford, or Reading; but all agree in regard
to Silchester. Its distance nearly accords with the Itinerary distance of
<i>Calleva</i> from London, Bath, Spene, Winchester, and Caerleon, and, if a
station (which is evidently lost) in the Iter of Antonine be supplied, with
that from Cirencester. The present remains are those of a great Roman
town; it is situated in the district formerly inhabited by the Atrebates;
and in every direction traces of Roman roads converging to this point still
plainly exist, from London, Spene, Winchester, Old Sarum, Bath, and
Cirencester.</p></div>

<p>'A cheap, very comely, and altogether desirable edition.'&mdash;<i>Westminster Gazette.</i></p>

prevents them being so regarded.'&mdash;<i>Studio.</i></p>

<p>'Handy in shape and size, wonderfully cheap, beautifully printed from the Cambridge
text, and illustrated quaintly yet admirably by Mr. Byam Shaw, we have nothing
but praise for it. No one who wants a good and convenient Shakespeare&mdash;without
excursuses, discursuses, or even too many notes&mdash;can do better, in our opinion, than
subscribe to this issue: which is saying a good deal in these days of cheap reprints.'&mdash;<i>Vanity

<p>'What we like about these elegant booklets is the attention that has been paid to the

<p>Dr. MURRAY, <i>Editor of the 'Oxford English Dictionary</i>,' says:&mdash;'In this its
latest form, and with its large Supplement and numerous appendices, it is a wonderful
volume, which well maintains its ground against all rivals on its own lines. The 'definitions,'
or more properly, 'explanations of meaning' in 'Webster' have always struck me
as particularly terse and well-put; and it is hard to see how anything better could be
done within the limits.'</p>

<p>Professor JOSEPH WRIGHT, M.A., Ph.D., D.C.L., LL.D., <i>Editor of
the 'English Dialect Dictionary</i>,' says:&mdash;'The new edition of "Webster's International
Dictionary" is undoubtedly the most useful and reliable work of its kind in any country.
No one who has not examined the work carefully would believe that such a vast amount
of lexicographical information could possibly be found within so small a compass.'</p>

<p>Professor A.H. SAYCE, LL.D., D.D., says:&mdash;'It is indeed a marvellous
work; it is difficult to conceive of a Dictionary more exhaustive and complete. Everything
is in it&mdash;not only what we might expect to find in such a work, but also what few
of us would ever have thought of looking for.'</p>

<p>Rev. JOSEPH WOOD, D.D., <i>Head Master of Harrow</i>, says:&mdash;'I have always
thought very highly of its merits. Indeed, I consider it to be far the most accurate
English Dictionary in existence, and much more reliable than the "Century." For
daily and hourly reference, "Webster" seems to me unrivalled.'</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
